Just back from bali trip . Location wise is good - which is very near the beach , But the hotel is supper horrible with so many mosquitos and you can ' t sleep peacefully every night .

This was my first time in Bali and I stayed here the first night . Great price . Location in Kuta was ideal . Wish I had another night but too short a time in Bali , I had to move on . Would absolutely stay here again .#### #### ####[([16], [15], 'POS'), ([18], [22], 'POS')]
Small hotel just on the border of the busy part of Kuta . No need for taxi to get to the sea . Also on the other more quiet side nice restaurants available .

I am not a type of person loving to stay in a " crowded " place like Kuta . But , just recently stayed in this hotel for a short transit . Nice live music by the entrance .

Its a good hotel for its price . It ' s centrally located in Kuta Beach . Malls and shops are of walking distance .

This would have to be the worst hotel I have stayed at in Bali . Rats around the pool , cockroaches in the breakfast area . No lighting in hall way at night time .

Interesting concept and design , friendly staff , has kids facilities ( play ground , swimming pool ) , strategic location ( approximately 4 KM from beach but it has shuttle bus - but we didn ' t try it ) .

Didn ' t stay in the hotel stopped for dinner while in the area , surprisingly good food and very cheap compared to the others in the area .

Every guest in this beautiful hotel has stunning view of the volcano - - that is , if it decides to peek out from the clouds . The food is so - so but the staff is extremely friendly .

It ' s a new hotel located far from Kuta & Legian , for those whoever stayed at Tune Hotel , it ' s similar .

Fairly small room for hotel for its price range . Although the room is quite neat and clean , it ' s not really hospitable for family or friends . More fit for couple or solo .

Stayed in 4 accommodations across Bali over 2 weeks . This one by far wins on its pool and the staff friendliness . Rooms were great with four poster bed , tv and wifi .

Stayed for a couple of nights , very clean room and bed linen . Water provided each day and mosquito coil provided each night , an excellent idea which we wish others would do !

This hotel is a good deal because it comes with only basic amenities .

It ' s great considering the value for money and location . Great Budget Hotel Its in between two of the major shopping mall , discovery and lippo mall . and all the good restaurants are nearby .

We stay for 4 nights , comparing with another hotels in Bali can select low price for double bed room , fast internet connection and plasma tv .

Not much good to report here other than the location next to Discovery .

This hotel is good price for money but you can find better in the same area .

Beatifull place , good prices for what they offer for but they dont speak english at all . They wont be bottering al the time to sell tours or trying to make money from you .

Not so close to city center but you can stay in a quiet zone , 10 min walking from city center . Good rooms and good service . Great price and good amenities . Didnt try the restaurant but it looks nice . We stay for two nights and the first day was less expensive than the 2nd night because we make the reservation online . .#### #### ####[([13], [12], 'POS'), ([23], [22], 'POS'), ([26], [25], 'POS'), ([29], [28], 'POS'), ([32], [31], 'POS'), ([37], [41], 'POS')]

Palm Beach Hotel has a convenient location at about 2 kilometers from Bali International airport and a walking distance from Kuta beaches and busy life and activities .

This is a good hotel near the airport . Although the room is not costly , some of the services were costlier than the other hotels . I had a very comfortable room in a good location .

The hotel is close to airport like 15min drive . The check - in staff is very efficient . Located near Waterbom Bali . However , Legian is a better option considering the surroundings .

Nice hotel with a beautiful pool directly at the beach !

So i went to Solaris on my last holiday for 3nights . Everyting was okay , and the hotel pricing is affordable plus the staff quite helpful .

This hotel is just a simple place with clean but rather basic rooms . But that ’ s just what you can expect for the room rate . The staff / owners are good and friendly people .

For budget hotel , Vilarisi is a good hotel as they have a roof top garden to be able to view Bali from above and experianced sunsets there . But the hotel seems quite old , need renovation and painting for some floor . Especially urgently fixed the lift as it is so weak and can nit used for ground floor .

Bathrooms look run down and are in well need of a makeover . Also we stayed on the bottom floor so just outside the back door we had direct access to the bottom pool .

In this Merucre I had very few sleep . First a Indian travel group made a party on the executive floor at 1am and 3am .

A decent boutique hotel in terms of comfort and cleanliness . The hotel could do with some minor refurbishments eg . Bathroom and furniture which are quite worn out .

We only stayed in solaris from 12pm - 7pm for short transit stay . Great budget hotel for the price . Staff very friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble .

My daughter stayed in this hotel for several days . The pool is painted dark but is very clean . I watched the staff clean it each day . The hotel assisted in renting motor scooters .

We stayed just two nights . Clean and very big rooms and hearty staff . The breakfast too was good and there was wide choice .

I came already several times to this hotel . The main reason is that is has quiet rooms which are fairly large , large swimming pool . The staff is very friendly and helpful . There are private villas as well , but i never tried one of those ( I travel alone ) .#### #### ####[([17], [16], 'POS'), ([17], [20, 21], 'POS'), ([24, 25], [23], 'POS'), ([28], [31], 'POS'), ([28], [33], 'POS')]
the rooms are small but very comfortable . clean room !

Stayed here for a few days in October , and the hotel is in a lovely location with very large rooms . The restaurant / breakfast were very good value and the service was faultless .

We look forward to seeing you next year .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([10], [8], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS'), ([24], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([33], [35], 'POS'), ([39], [38], 'POS')]
What a wonderful experience to step into the fabulous gardens of the Melia Bali and start a magnificent holiday . The staff of the Level are amazing as are Darma and Resti serving guests at the pool and the beach . Sudiatini cleans the resort beautifully . From relaxing by the pool to eating at the restaurants you wont regret staying at the Melia .#### #### ####[([9], [8], 'POS'), ([21], [26], 'POS')]
Amazing service ! Desak and Gede provided exceptional service at Sorrento restaurant . We were so well looked after . They were friendly and accomodating and really took pride in making us feel welcome . We went back 3 times . The food was equally delicious !#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([42], [45], 'POS')]
There is nothing to do in Nuda Dua for a solo traveler . The hotel charges 300 % mark - up for everything including activities . The food sucks and it is definitely not a 5 star . It is an old hotel that needs a serious revamp . No usb port to charge your phone , old TVs . TINY room . I hated my stay here .#### #### ####[([14], [18, 19, 20], 'NEG'), ([27], [28], 'NEG'), ([58], [57], 'NEG'), ([61], [60], 'NEG')]

We originally only planned to stay for 1 night but ended up coming back and staying for more nights because we were very impressed with the resort . Our daughter spent time in the kids club and loved it , they had great activities and the ladies there were great . We would definitely recommend Melia Bali and it ’ s kids club for families .#### #### ####[([26], [23], 'POS'), ([34, 35], [37], 'POS'), ([43], [42], 'POS'), ([46], [49], 'POS')]
Overall a disappointing experience staying here . The resort is missing all the final touches for this to be a 5 star . Would say it is more like a 3 star property . Prices on food and drink are very high and quality isn ’ t great . There is other nicer hotels in Nusa Dua that I would recommend instead .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'NEG'), ([8], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG'), ([34], [41], 'NEG'), ([36], [34], 'NEG'), ([43], [44, 45, 46, 47], 'NEG'), ([53], [51, 52], 'NEG')]

Why average ? Its just like the other great hotels located in Nusa Dua . Its a family friendly hotel , with their marshmallow - BBQ in the afternoon at the beach , with their kids activities inside .

Stayed in pool access room for 2 weeks . It is my longest stay ever in a hotel . Really recommend this type of room . The restaurant facing the beach is the best in Nusa dua in my opinion .

Had an awesome 3 night staycation and absolutely loved my stay . The rooms were large and clean , the jungle facing balcony was amazing .

Very cheap price for a decent room . The staff were also very helpful and nice . They were professional and follows covid - 19 protocols . The rooms were decent and fitted for its price .

smooth checked in . double six beach is nearby . we stayed on 3rd floor , room is pretty clean but the shortage was only we still could hear the noise from outside our room . the glassdoor in the bathroom also made cracking sounds whenever we pushed or pulled it . quite annoying i guess .

We moved to this Hotel because its closer to the Double Six Beach . But it was truly a wrong decision . The room smelled very musty , it was unclean and dirty .

We were paying about £17 a night which in my opinion was far too much .

If you are looking for a cheaper alternative for Bali and do not plan to do much in the hotel , this is for you . The bathrooms were fair size but the room itself was pretty small .

value for money , simple and clean . Only minus is the early check out at 11 . 00 am . Especially when u know that most flights to europe will leave in the night . After a stay of 5 nights I could extend it to 12 . 00 am . Later they would have charged me . . .#### #### ####[([2], [0], 'POS')]

We stayed 1 night on arriving and also on leaving Bali . This hotel offers excellent 24 hour airport service for arrivals and departures . The rooms are clean , quiet and affordable . The free wifi is a tad slow but it gets there . Its about a 20min walk to Kuta otherwise the are plenty of taxis on the street . Its a great place to acclimatise .#### #### ####[([18, 19], [15], 'POS'), ([26], [28], 'POS'), ([26], [30], 'POS'), ([26], [32], 'POS'), ([35, 36], [39, 40], 'NEG'), ([58], [56], 'POS'), ([66], [65], 'POS')]
This place is ideal if you want to spend the night close to the airport . The rooms or rather small . The breakfast is not included .

Booked thru Agoda and during the booking it ' s hard to notice that they have this Transit offer which means you can only use the room for 7hrs and you have to pay 135 , 000 IDR equivalent to 10 USD to avail the room for overnight .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([3], [0], 'POS')]
It is a hotel that is very near Ngurah Rai Airport , only take 5 minutes by car . The airport shuttle is very good as it saves money from the expensive taxi at the airport counter .

So . . . you are in transit waiting for your next flight and have been kicked out of your hotel at mid - day . This is the answer . 10 minutes by their free shuttle to the airport .
