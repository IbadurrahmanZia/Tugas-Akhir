"Stayed here for 1 night when we were unable to board our flight this week since it ’ s right by the airport . The rooms are disappointing , outdated and don ’ t seem very clean . No amenities aside from hand soap and bath towels . The ac kept our room cold but dripped all night , we had to stick a trash can underneath it and listen to it drip while we tried to sleep . We asked for a nonsmoking room but there was an ash tray in it ( didn ’ t smell though ) . The staff that brought us to the room was not friendly and didn ’ t help us with our bags up many flights of stairs , he just walked far ahead and let us deal with them . Breakfast was minimal and not very good . Only plus side is location and the pool . We paid hardly any more for a much nicer resort the night before , wish we had just gone back",751602005
"Was a bit hesitant to stay based on other reviews . Stayed in room 306 for $ 35 aus per night . Room was clean and well maintained , also room was cleaned daily . Great air con that chilled the room quickly . Staff were amazing also smiling and quick to joke with us . Very honest and highly recommend money change with great rates directly opposite the hotel . See Bec in the shop next door for SIM card for your phone . Close to lippo mall for the supermarket they are a bit pricey so only went there when I could not access the things I needed in Circle K . Great restaurants near by , if you turn left out of the hotel into the lane way , there is a fantastic cafe just down the lane way on the right hand side . The best pork ribs ever .

"We stayed here in Feb 2005 because it was one of the "" package deal "" hotels listed on our booking . We didnt expect much as it was a lead in hotel but were very happy with the location . It had a clean pool by the meals pavilion . Mostly the guests seemed to be more the retiring type so it was very quiet day and night . It is located down a lane away from the main road which also helped keep it quiet . It was serviced by a strip of shops covering all the basics from internet access to t - shirts and art etc . on the way to the main road . It was also walking distance to the beach . Only a 10 minute walk to the centre of Kuta and in the other direction a fabulous and modern bakery and supermarket owned the Chinese Emporium .

"I loved Bakungs Beach Cottages . A good budget hotel , which helped for me as I come from U . S . and flight is very long - - so I want to stay in Bali at least three weeks . The staff were all friendly and helpful . I felt right at home there and enjoyed the other guests as well . Pool was great after a day at the beach . I encountered NO rudeness from any of the staff , and that is unheard of in this day and age . Everyone was eager to help , assist and just have a normal conversation . I travel alone for the most part and the hotel is safe and quiet . There are shops along the road and when you want something different than what is on the menu at Bakung ' s , there was a great warung just down the road to the left of Bakung ' s Beach Cottages .

"We booked in to Bakung ' s Beach Cottages based only on price and the fact that we could get adjoining rooms as we wanted to have a two week holiday on a budget . Then we read the reviews here and were a little worried about what to expect ! It was great ! The rooms were basic and old , but they were clean , and cleaned every day ; roomy with a TV and small fridge , and the breakfast which was included in the price was good . The kids enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed the loungers beside it . The air cons were great and there were no bugs , insects or vermin ! The hotel is located about 5 mins walk from the beach one way or 2 mins from the main street and 10 mins walk to Waterbom Park and Discovery Plaza .

The double room was great - it ' s spacious with a big bathroom , flat screen TV ( with cable - good choice of channels ) , big balcony , fridge , wardrobe and free bottles of water every day . The rooms were cleaned very well every day even if you asked them to come back at a later time . We arrived at 3am but checked in fine ! The location is good and quiet down a side road . It ' s right next to the Lippo Mall ( 2 mins ) which has a supermarket , cinema and restaurants .

Now we go to the pool area which is great , the water in the pool is clean and around there during the day is quite social with the other guest staying there . The pool bar does not open but the restuarant is right there if you want a drink or food . The gardens around the hotel are amazing .

I have stayed at Bakung Beach Cottages several times over the past 3 years . It is an adequate stay for the Traveller on a budget or someone just looking for a nice cool room to rest between sessions at the many of the islands clubs . To all out there who label it the worst place or horrible I suggest stop being a cheapskate and fork out the extra $ 250 for something 5 star .,121724578

"Doesn ’ t make much sense to be booked into your flash south Bali hotel / resort first night if your flight arrives post 20 . 00 – you have paid for the great view , rim pool , gym , restaurant yada but all you will see on late arrival ( add at least an hour for the airport and the trip from , although the latter can be much more in South Bali ' s horrendous pre - midnight traffic ) is the inside of your hotel room for a short while ( hopefully ) – before the zzzzs kick in . Way better to head for a near - airport lower midrange place with quiet comfy rooms . Which BAKUNG does well . Similarly if your flash resort is anywhere north of halfway to UBUD or south - west of BALANGAN , you don ’ t want to spend more than an hour ANYTIME OF DAY squashed up in a cab or resort shuttle after a long tiring flight .",685101496
"In about 20 trips to Bali this is the worst hotel I have stayed at . Thought I would try it for 2 nights as the pictures through Agoda ( & other booking sites ) looked good . I have stayed at a lot more expensive and a couple cheaper . In my second room after complaining about the 1st and am now looking forward to tomorrow morning to book out and go elsewhere . The rooms are dirty , the not plugged in fridge was filthy with mould and other substances in it . The sheets and towels - which none have been left from making the room up this morning - are threadbare and a dirty colour . Have just watched 2 older women cart their bags up 3 flights of stairs . Staff are not rude but of no help . The rooms I have seen are old and depressing with no safe to lock things in . Breakfast is just passable",295558103
"I ' m writing this review at the same time as we are staying here . This is a place that is clearly on the way up . We noted all the bad older reviews before we got here and the better recent ones , and that pretty much tells the story . It seems there must ' ve been LOTS of improvements over the past few months . Yep , there ' s still a bit to go , but for the price , this place is a gem . Nice pool w / swim up bar , clean rooms with king size beds ( and air con ) and lovely gardens , it ' s a perfect place to radiate from for your Bali stay . The cons : Water pressure a little light on the top ( third ) floor . Still some broken tiles in the pool ( though they ' re not really dangerous ) . Breakfast choices maybe a bit lean for some .

"I have stayed here each time I arrive in Bali and find Bakung ' s Beach Hotel to be comfortable and affordable accommodation close to the airport . This is really convenient when arriving later at night as it saves a long trip in to the Kuta / Legian area at a time when the traffic is not flowing quickly . There are also two shopping malls close by . The new Lippomall is right next door and the Discovery Mall a 15 minute walk away . Bakung ' s Beach Hotel is not on the beach but quite close and access to the waterfront is possible through the Pantai Inn restaurant grounds .

It was so terrible that we decided to move hotels . The hotel advertises its rack rates at AUD $ 60 , but you can find it advertised for cheaper on other sites . I ' ve travelled in Vietnam and stayed in budget accommodation , paying around US $ 20 per night . ; I wouldn ' t pay USD $ 20 for this place , or anymore than AUD $ 15 ! I don ' t think it provides good value for money . It would be an okay place to sleep if you can overlook its tiredness and general grottiness .

It ' s a hidden gem tucked away the reception is a decent climb up many stairs you are greeted with a refreshing smile and very cold drink . The rooms are very neat and clean this hotel recently had an upgrade and the bathrooms are very big and clean the restaurant is basic but the food is amazing the best is the MI goreng the pool is very large and has a swim up bar . the beach is about a 5 minute walk and the main street is at the end of the lane all the stall sellers on the street are lovely for a cheap hotel I can ' t knock it I have been to this hotel about 6 times and I ' m drawn back by the relaxing feeling I get from it,467159630
"Excellent location right next to the new lippo mall . We had a room the backed into the mall and the motorbikes starting at 6am going into the car park and all the talking behind us was painful . Room was not cleaned to my liking . Breakfast was poor at best . Stayed with friends who woke up covered in bed bug bites . Kids used the pool and within seconds were screaming about the water in their eyes . Told them just not to put their heads under the water , but then when they got out the were covered in chemical burns ( all the kids 6 in total so not just a one off child with sensitive skin ! ) the pool bar was not open , and restaurant staff would not even walk the two steps down yo the pool to serve us drinks .

"I have used this property in the past for a stop over being close to the Airport & Kuta attractions which makes life easy . Booking online has been easy & so affordable that there is money in the pocket to get out & see Bali .

I just brought my family here on my last visit , we had two connecting rooms & went out and did tours during the day & home to sit around the pool . Kids loved it . New Lippo mall next door . Resturant Pantai down on the beach & it ' s 6 , 000 rup ' s ( 50c ) to catch a blue cab to Kuta square .

Bakung Beach hotel is not the Hilton but the $ 1500 i saved went a long way to my wifes Shopping and my Bintang expenditure . Pool and area around pool have been refurbished with new lounges .

"I ' ve stayed here a number of times now and every time it ' s a great experience . It is evident with the influence of my long time friend Robert Rajendra , the GM of the Bakungs group of hotels , this humble hotel is reaching for the stars . My first experience was with fairly dingy rooms and a breakfast menu that was laughable , albeit sufficient . The hotel has undergone significant building renovations and very recently , an upgrade to the guest facilities that incorporated a complete make over of the pool area . The introduction of a coffee corner , swim up bar revamp and overhaul of the breakfast menu makes the Bakungs outrageous value for money .

Comfy enough beds , good air con , good shower ( although the bathroom was very small ) and a TV .

This hotel is a bit run down but it is cheap and ideally situated . It is only a short drive from the airport which is what you want when youa rrive jet lagged ! It is 10 minutes walk to the beginning of the main Kuta area and five minutes walk from the beautiful Tuban beach . The thing to do is by some bleach and clean the bathroom to your own standards . Don ; t get me wrong - it is not filthy ! but you will feel better if you do this . Make sure the grating is fixed over the drain in the bathroom otherwise you will get rats coming up through the hole . Bali has many rats and Bakung ' s Beach has its fair share .

Quality of premises is bad . Staffs are friendly but not knowledgeable . Definitely not handicap friendly . Bedding was hard . Towels were clean . Breakfast isn ’ t recommended at all . There ’ s a good and cheap massage place right across the road though .,544278109
"We ' ve booked a room for 3 persons . When we came in there were only 2 beds and one matras on the ground . The pictures on the website did show uw a room with 3 normal beds . When we ' ve asked for a normal bed it was really difficult to get it . The staff were really unfriendly at the reception , haven ' t seen a smile at all . Eventually we ' ve got the extra bed . The rooms were really dirty , there were a lot of string of hair on the ground . Like if they did not swipe the room for a month . We had cockrouches in our bathroom and a lot of mult . Also the shower was cold . The fridge did not work at all . The only nice thing was the pool with the bar inside . We were glas we ' ve only booked for one night . Never going back to this place again , no one should .",531121159
"We Booked 4 rooms , 2 with extra beds for our family . The pool whilst large had many broken , sharp tiles and the ph levels were obviously well off as many eye and skin irritations . The rooms whilst spacious were poorly equipped and bathrooms in a very poor state . Air cons worked quite well . Tom cats everywhere which urinated on 1 of our doors leaving an aroma which could not be removed and infiltrated the room . Breakfast was adequate but not great . Worst feature was the shocking bed bug bites our 9 year old received . He was covered in them and his holiday quite spoilt . This is a low price hotel and we didn ’ t expect a lot but this issue was inexcusable .",530082607
"I am still currently ill from visiting Bali 6 months ago and I feel like this place has a lot to do with it . Our room had two single beds pushed together . Breakfast was terrible as bees were everywhere . Over 4 cats that will literally walk into your room but all were very lovely . Two male staff members were so lovely - they added us on Facebook at the end of our trip but upon going through their photos they go though guests rooms and take funny pictures with their items - alcohol , sunglasses . I found this very unprofessional . Bathroom was clogged and sewage came up the shower drain . Was told this would be fixed - it took the whole day and stunk of poo . The next day the same thing happened . Went down to reception and got placed in a new room - no problems with clogging in this",493740830
"recently stayed at Bakung Beach Resort , Do not give them your bank account details they access your account without your knowledge charge a extra day plus $ 10 not sure what that was for and refuse to give back the money ) is no way I would recommend anyone to stay here it ' s true what they say you get what you pay for but you certainly don ' t expect this , there is no jug or coffee facilities , would not stay there with children , The kids pool has tiles falling off it my daughter picked out tiles and would ' ve filled half a will Barra , There is a swim bar but however it ' s not open , The surrounds around the pool is dangerous , I watched a woman fall over poor furniture and split her head open got wedged between the steps going into the breakfast room and the pool surrounds",487680012
"last holiday to bali we stayed at two hotels , , , one at the upper end in price . it was great . we enjoyed it very much . all that you really pay for was given to us . . we have stayed at bakungs a few times over the years and love this hidden gem of a hotel . i have made over 60 trips to bali since the 1960 s and seen it all . the people at bakungs are the best and so is this hotel . we always come back . ive taken my kids there when they were young and they had a ball . it is a budget hotel but in my view you get what you pay for but bakungs offers more . . my wife and i will be back there in july 17 and i cant wait to see all those happy faces again . for the critics i say get a life ! ! !",487192308
Rooms was average but for the price what u expect staff nice Pool was green and got rash but if its working normal its fine pool bar is ok Sum rooms are renovated now so thry would be alright I will find out in june what new rooms are like staff are freindly,475201985
"I stayed for 5 Days 4 Nights during the Christmas . Its a budgeted resort with swimming pool , within walking distance from Kuta beach and Lippo mall . Housekeeping team is good always quick and clean for cleaning our room . The breakfast is not that great we only had for one time and choose for get best to get something on the street or in the mall by walk . I think it is old properties so you can imagine . Over all , good value for money , location is great",450591603
"Great a / c huge beds , clean , quiet , TV with satellite , pool swim up bar and includes breakfast , just 100m to Lippomall . Lots of surfers stay here as it ' s very close to the boats that go out to Kuta Reef . We have stayed a number of times generally for a month at a time . The price is great for long stays . I access most places by walking along the beach path only 10 minutes walk to Kuta for sunset drinks at the beach bars .",440771094
"I stayed , here , for 3 nights ; and , loved the location ( close to airport ) , ambiance , and , newer features in my room ! I discovered this small family - style Balinese hotel , while roaming the streets in the Kuta area . Amidst larger construction ; and , behind the "" Lippo "" Mall ; this hotel was a jewel in the rough ! ! The hotel has a lovely pool , gardens , and , interesting Temple ' s ( for the staff ) . My room has 2 single beds , ( very comfortable ) , a balcony with 2 chairs and a table and drying rack for laundry / wet suits . The tile floors were spotless , and the whole room seems to have been recently renovated . My only dislike was the shower in the nice sized bathroom . Their was no shower curtain or shelf in the shower area ( for your soap and shampoo ) ; so , I had to place these items on",434515617

"We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in October 2016 . Here are some of the pros and cons of our stay : Pros : Location - it is conveniently located in the same street as the Lippo mall which has a nice big supermarket with everything you need . It is also very close to the beach and 10 minute ' s walk to discovery mall . It is 5 minutes ' drive from the airport . Pool - it has a very nice , big pool with a pool bar which is very cool Outside - the outside area of the hotel ( outside the rooms ) has a tropical paradise feeling to it , lots of trees , green grass , flowers - it really is just beautiful Bed - we had a very comfortable big bed Aircon - our aircon worked well Neatness - the room was neat and tidy and cleaned every day Breakfast - breakfast was included in our stay and we",426871952

A / c broken froze at night , wouldn ' t give extra blankets or pillows . Hot water very unreliable , sometimes hot , mostly tepid . Broken tiles in shower resulted in cut foot . BYO pool towel , lots of tiles in the over chlorinated pool also broken . Breakfast very ordinary , always running out of cutlery , glasses , plates , food , condiments . Some of the restaurant staff were good , others not . Free WiFi can only sometimes be accessed in lobby restaurant & pool surrounds , never in room areas . Found office staff not very helpful or nice . This is one place I will never return or recommend to anyone .",338089033
"for au $ 30 its very good value , includes brekky . We only stayed a few nights to catch up with friends before going to Candi Dasa . Sure there are some things that need attention but , this is Bali . Its a traditional structure , nice grounds , pool and restaurant . Again , rooms are very basic but given you don ' t spend all that much time there , who cares . Freindly staff , central position , close to the beach and Kuta Square close by . Super quiet at night , except maybe for some dogs barking now and then . Our room was on the ground floor , private patio surrounded by gardens . Close to the airport . The pool is quite large with a swim up bar . The main section is deep , 2 metres but joins up to kids pool . Not a lot of sun lounges , fresh towels can be scarce . Comfy beds , air con , tv , daily free water .",315473991

"The rooms are simple , bathroom is not the cleanest I have seen , but ok . Beds are fine and clean . Pool area is nice , even though the pool has so much chlorine that I could not open my eyes under water . Breakfast is toast , rice or noodles an fruits . People are friendly and helpful . Location is good , 15 walking minutes to the beach with nice waves . Right next to a big moll . Enough restaurants and mini markets in walking distance . 10 minutes drive to the airport .",260967838
"Stayed one night and was surprised at the value for money here . Rooms are ok , aircon works great and I heard no noise at night . The pool was great , very big with lots of sun .

"Two minute walk to the beach , which was awesome . But the hotel is located next to a shopping mall & the street is busy with traffic , suggest getting a room away from road as it ' s impossible to sleep , you hear everything ! Room was spacious , air conditioning worked great & the wifi was excellent . beds were very hard though & no safety deposit box to lock stuff up . However , nothing went missing while we were out . Staff were excellent , very happy & fun to be around .",240468031
Wasnt expecting much due to the price £ 17 a night we paid upon arrival we were greeted with a welcome drink and a smile ! Rooms were basic but very spacious with a balcony fridge air con and a tele and the room was cleaned daily with fresh towles provided ! The best part of the hotel is the pool and gardens really beautifull and well maintained ! The restaraunt is really cheap and the food is fresh and homemade ! The beach is the best ive ever seen and only a 5 min walk and the hotel is just off the beaten track of the lively and noisy strip and u cnt here a thing ! Loved our stay and would deffo go back !,233047764
"My husband and I recently stayed here for 3 weks . The location is perfect for those who want to be close enough to Kuta to shop , you can walk the paved boardwalk , or get a taxi for $ 1 . It is far enough from the nightclub scene that you aren ' t disturbed in the evenings . There are also a few places to eat closeby and a new shopping mall , Lippo Mall , next door . The rooms are basic but have all you need and they have a nice balcony for drinks in the evening . The breakfast was ok , with a few choices and when we realised we could get the food heated in their microwave it made all the differance , hot food . The pool was very relaxing set among the usual lush gardens of Bali . We will definately stay there again .",225589608
"This hotel is cheap and basic , rooms have A / C , TV satellite , small fridge hot water . The rooms are large and comfortable but dated . Breakfast is also basic toast fruit tea and coffee . There is a nice pool area . My husband surfs and this is very close to Kuta Reef and the airport . If you haven ' t been to Bali before I would suggest you look elsewhere . I found it fine but not the Ritz .",216138052
"I was captured by the 100m to beach description , yes you are 100 meters to the beach , but then another solid 1 - 2 km from the real beach . Walking distance to shopping though . Rooms clean , brekky is rice . Descent , but there is better for similar prices . I also didn ' t like the little ally it was on , as a blonde I was frequently harassed by store keepers . I would google map double six beach or hard rock hotel and pick places near them . Far from each other , but best beach locations .",215449835

Boy were we wrong ! We arrived and were greeted with complimentary drinks which was a nice start but it went downhill from there . We were showed to our room which was a rather long walk so my girlfriend had to carry her large travel bag all that way without an offer from any staff to carry it which was rather ignorant considering all other hotels we have been in so far have done that ! The room itself looked nice , however the a / c didn ' t work properly so it was freezing ! The showers drain was awful so water didn ' t drain properly !

"Our stay from 11 May2014 to 17 May 2014 . Superior twin Room . Although the Hotel now no longer has a beach front nor sight of the Sea ( a 5 min walk is now needed to access the Beach ) , this is a rustic and serene peace of property that is value for Money . For less than US30 with breakfast thrown in you get a restful stay after a hectic touring day , The courtyard pool and generous matured landscaped garden with total privacy from the outside is much appreciated . The Pool may be small but clean ; actually deep enough and nice with a small shallow section at one corner for children . One can even do some mini laps and soak away all tired limbs . Adjacent is a basic restaurant operating from 7am to 10pm and in the day a seperate coffee bar as well . The rooms are clean . , its really",206729556

There are stray cats living on the grounds ( we saw at least 6 ) . The room was infested with Mosquitos & my friend had bed bugs in her bed . The room is noisy by day & by night , during the night all you can hear is traffic , screaming from the streets & power tools being used at all hours . We didnt even attempt to use the pool as it didnt look appealing & we went to have brekkie at the hotel restaurant but were stared down by other patrons / staff & the food didnt look good so we went elsewhere . This hotel is more of a hostel & would barely be fit for a backpacker . Save your money & go for something a bit classier because this",186794465
Simple small hotel and yeah they are not that organised at times but it is good location for the cost which was around Aus $ 25 / night . The rooms are basic and nothing flash and you might have to get some glasses for yourself but there are little almost private balconies or terraces . The bed is a little too firm but have had that at expensive hotels . there is aircon and a fridge . Location is tucked away from noisy street and close to beach and Kartiki plaza shopping / restaurants etc . Food at restaurant was basic but OK .,186596097

"We stayed here for one night before an early flight the next morning . The price for the rooms was outstanding but yes it is a little tired and dated but clean enough . The pool was large and clean and the food very reasonably priced . I would consider staying here again as long as our room did not back onto the new shopping centre , as the air conditioning unit was loud and it was hard to get to sleep . There are a lot of stairs which you may need to consider if you struggle with them . Overall if you are not too fussy this would satisfy a family on a budget holiday .",181442748

"We stayed overnight at Bakung Beach Hotel , as we arrived late at night , the lady in reception very pleasant and welcoming . We had our 18 year old grand daughter with us , so we had 2 rooms side by side . The rooms are clean , basic , and comfortable , all we needed . The included breakfast is very good . This hotel is just a short walk to the Tuban beach one way , and a short walk to Kuta shops . , Bakung hotel has a lovely swimming pool , quite large beside the restraunt . If you are coming to Bali , we recommend Bakung Beach Hotel , if you wish to stay in the Kuta area , it is up a narrow street , and is very quiet .

The bathroom was clean neat and tidy although the engineering meant that water from the shower collected around the pan . More towels please ! ! Didi I care ! No , at around 35 a night it ' s not 5 * quality . Ill be coming back . Nice to see lots more Aussies and families . Pools always good and well kept",165137046

I must say , for a 2 * hotel it compares with some higher rated establishments . Maybe not as up to date , with older facilities and mountainous front office steps that are slippery after rains BUT its hard to argue against clean linen daily , room fridge , good air con lovely little pool that ' s well maintained and close to everything . I mean where else is all this including a fair breakfast for less that $ AUD40 a night ?",146055449
"We stayed at this motel and reviewed it 12 months ago . We had such a nice time , we returned in April this year . The motel is looking older and is more rundown ; with building going on beside it , it is also noisy during the day . The bathroom was not just old , it is mouldy and leaking . That said , the aircon worked well , the beds were clean , we had no bugs or vermin and at all times felt safe and welcome . The swimming pool is old ( broken tiles in places ) but water quality was great and the kids loved it . We had no problems with breakfast and we love the laundry service directly across the lane .

After complaining we were moved to another room on the top floor , a little better but not much at all . The bathrooms were the worst I ' ve seen . Friends at a near by hotel left several messages with reception and we never received them , also our phone didn ' t work and we complained AFTER our friends had left messages and still they didn ' t let us know ! Then tried to charge us some ridiculous price to use their reception phone to call a local number . Didn ' t bother with the breakfast after our first try had ants crawling all over the plate . Bed bugs , towels gray with holes . I could go on and on but I ' ll leave it as my worst travel experience .",128029559

My wife was bitten by the flees and required attention at the international hospital , then had to endure a treatment having to cover the bits with a cream and taking ant - histermens lasting 1 week . We were moved to another room at 3 am the roof leaked when it rained . The hotel would not pay for the doctors and asked to be payed for the nights we stayed which I refused and had to get the tourist police involved , we move to a clean hotel and completed our trip . Three things you need to stay at this hotel . • Good health insurance • Next hotel booked as you will require movement • Local Legal advice",127344013
"I ended up staying here a few nights as I couldn ' t get a room at my normal hotel , and friends were staying just around the corner . I think I paid about $ 35aud for a room and would not pay the $ 60 that other reviewers had got charged . The grounds are really lovely actually , but the rooms are more than a bit tired . The mothballs - oh my gosh ! Hidden in every nook and cranny in the room and gave me a headache . I ended up finding them all and putting them outside . Staff were polite , but not friendly - very unlike the balinese at every other place I have stayed . With a refurb and a course on smiling at guests this could be a really good spot .",118840411

The hotel was close ( 6500 rupiah for the taxi from the airport ) but the room was the worst I ' ve ever had in Bali ( 19 trips since 1981 ) . What really annoyed me though was the very poor service . Apart from the staff being rude and unfriendly , I asked them when I checked in if they would ring for a taxi for me at 4am when I checked out . ' No problem sir ' . When I checked out I was immediately told the taxis were all busy , but they would take me to the airport for 50 000 rupiah . I then walked 50 mtrs down the road and found 4 taxis parked there . Next time I will stay elsewhere .",69159607
Be careful staying here : the streets around this hotel are most definitely not safe at night . Do NOT let your children go out of the hotel compound after dark . Beware of motorbike bandits in the area . Otherwise this hotel is a case of ' you get what you pay for ' : mediocrity . It ' s close to the airport but too far from the more interesting parts of Bali .,54976396

Towels - variable from fluffy to thin but always available . If you are fussy about soft pillows - take your own . We shall return .",50018524
"I was expecting the worse , being as cheap as this hotel was , we normaly stay at more expencive hotels , but this trip we were staying a month , so needed cheaper . I have to admid i LOVE this hotel , we had a clean room , the aircon worked fine , there is only one english chanel on tv , but we dont watch tv whilst on holidays , the bathroom was clean , and the staff impecable to say the least . The pool area does need some work , but for the price it was fantastic , the resturant meals were cheap and a great range of meals were available . I love the location , not in the hussle and bussle of Kuta but within 5000Rp taxi ride to the centre of Kuta ( equivelent to around 70c ) The hotel is located in a small street , where the locals are more than happy to help out and become aquainted without",43514855
"Stayed here for 4 nights ; two rooms with children . Very cheap accommodation , around $ 40 per room per night with breakfast Pros : - The location of the hotel is very good , rooms are fairly clean and staff very friendly . - Buffet breakfast was good for $ 4 - 5 per person , with younger children free . Best recommendation is to ask for the fresh eggs / omelettes . - Good warungs nearby ( opposite Lippo Mall ) - Ground floor rooms are quiet and good for sleeping . Cons : - Rooms are excessively noisy unless you get a ground floor room . Constant traffic noise , building / construction and very loud air conditioners ( had to move rooms 3 times due to this ) - TVs in rooms would randomly lose reception - Air conditioners were not reliable , often not working early in the morning - Pool needs some",693014668
"Location is great but it is a Bradley run down hotel Started to rain and within a hour mould appeared on the walks of the room , you could brush the spores of with your hand . Moved to another room and it was infested with ants that crawled through the bed . Bed linen was filthy with hair on the sheets , I don ’ t believe sheets were changed from the last occupants . Pathways just a patchwork of uneven concrete , pool has chipped and broken tiles , lighting very dim walking through complex at night . More like a backpackers than a hotel . All I can say is it is a dump and to avoid it .",666128702
"We stayed for 10 nights - 6 of us travelling . The rooms are basic and the bathrooms could do with remodelling - but you travel to another country to see things so you are not in the room much . Bed was hard which I like . Staff were absolutely wonderful - beautiful people . Breakfast was good I only ever had eggs and fruit anyway . Everything else we ordered in the way of food was yum and a really good price , location is good and leather shop across the road will make what ever you want but don ’ t forget to barter because they will overcharge if you let them .",624327518
"We used this hotel as we had a late flight , pretty cheap at $ 40 but also very basic and one step up from a hostel as you would expect for the price . Positives are that it is in a great location almost attached to Lippo Mall and a 5 - 10min walk to Discovery Mall and Waterbom , old tired room and the pool gave my family a nasty rash",621524189

Stayed here with family for 3 days . We arrived at around 2 am . Just few minutes away ( no more than 10 - 15 minutes by taxi - so you should pick the ' right ' ride from airport - avoid the taxi scams ! - we - family of 3 - paid 100K fro taxi ride which we thought was reasonable given that it was 2 AM and it was raining like crazy - hey you gotta help the local bali economy rolling ! ) from Denpasar airport . Was met by reception staff after getting soaked under the rain and shoes wet ( due to flood just outside and even inside the grounds of the hotel ) . We were given a nice room although a bit far / back side of the hotel away from the pool and restaurant . We requested to be transferred to another room . Make sure you book or request a room in ground floor with balcony facing the gardens .,562200271
"We arrived late one evening ( around 6pm ) without a booking to enquire about room availability . We were told by Reception , yes , they had several room types available and the best rate could be found on Agoda , rather than booking with them direct ( which seemed very weird , but . . . err . . . ok ) . So we used Agoda on our phone in their reception to book a ' Deluxe Room with Extra Bed "" including Breakfast for 3 people . We showed them our booking confirmation and they agreed , but showed us a room which didn ' t remotely matched the booking we ' d made . They said if we want the room we booked , we have to pay more . We inspected several room options - all uninviting . No matter what discussions we had subsequently , nothing made sense . They seemed to have a poor attitude and were a bit dismissive .",551890835

( after words with them the next day they moved us closer but not next to each other . Its not a bad hotel for the price but needs some work . The Bathrooms are run down and a rather weird setup , rooms were cleaned daily and restaurant food was really good .

"This hotel should have been a little gem , its staff were lovely , the gardens ware lovely and the location was ideal but the negatives far out weighed the positives . * There were many mangy looking cats in the dinning area , ( we saw up to 5 at a time ) rubbing up against people wanting food . One cat jumped on a table , I found this utterly disgusting and we NEVER ate there again . * The milk tastes off . * There is NO BACON for breakfast , breakfast on offer is very basic , we found The Grill across from Lippomall was good or if you don ' t mind a small walk head to Febris Hotel their breakfast is amazing . Or little café Gala Mor just out side . * The water in the shower always ran hot and cold and the bathroom was in need of a bloody good clean . ( Mould in the corners ) * The power",525038854
"We arrived just before midday & received our customary drink . Great welcome from the staff . We had to change our room as there was an adjoining door & we could see through to next door . The breakfast menu was no different to 4years ago & not enjoyable at all . Some of the staff were quite rude to some visitors & were given a reprimand by them . Kuta itself has gone downhill a lot . Visitors , including ourselves , are being ripped off by money changers who are living off money stolen during the counting exchange process , so travellers be alert or go to one of the banks located all over Kuta . We found the whole time there disappointing with changes made in the shopping centers to high priced goods no cheaper than in Aussie & the attitude of the people changed so much this will be our",510343720
"Stayed here a couple of times and found it basic but clean . I have been in a renovated room both times . Older rooms are still getting done but okay . Pool was clean but no cocktails there . All the grog bottles seem to be for show only . Food was good and not expensive . Breakfast buffet included with the room was not a bad selection each day as well . Good central location and close to beach , airport , shops Lippo Mall right next door as well . I would stay here again .",509702276
Nice pool - probably the only nice thing at this hotel . all the rest about this hotel is terrible . Rooms are ugly and uncomfortable and we were staying in a superior room . In - room toilets ugly and uncomfortable . Breakfast was not impressive either .,509326663
"I had booked into Bakungs for 7 nights through Bookingdotcom . On day of arrival I was told my room would not be ready until until 5pm . I was with two friends who were also checking in and their rooms were ready . When we asked why my room was not ready we were told that there were still people in my room who wernt leaving until 5pm . OK , not a great start as check in is at 2pm . They did say they could provide me with a room with 2 single beds but I declined this as I had booked a double bed room and it had been confirmed . ok . I will put my bags into my friends room until 5pm and then come back to check in . I needed a late check out on leaving and asked if there was any chance as my room was ready could we negotiate a late check out with no extra charge . I thought this was fair .",501828042
"The resort is located ten - fifteen minutes walking from the airport in Denpasar . The beach is also very cose and on the main road there are a lot od restaurants and clubs where you can spend your leisure time and having lunch and dinner . Inside the hotel there is a nice small swimming pool and all around beautiful greenery . The place is quiet . Personnel is kind but not professional . The service is minimal , some plates could scare you , for example "" Margarita pizza "" with ketchup instead of italian passata , anyway the prices of the restaurant such as hotel ' s ones are very low , you can have a dinner for two for 10 dollars . The WiFi is in all the building but sometimes the connection is instable . Recap , honest price to enjoy Bali without eccesso pretensions .",495611148
Was booked into this hotel for three nights . On arriving late ( 1 . 30am ) after plane was delayed there was no one at reception . Waited a good 20 mins til someone finally came . Was given a room way down the back and up many flights of stairs . First impression of the room was OMG . . . . . . it was nothing like the pictures . . . . . it was terrible . . . . . very small room . . bugs . . . . . aircon didnt work . . . . fridge not cold . . . . bed squeaky and uncomfortable . Asked to be moved and was moved to a bigger room and more stairs . Bed was the same . . . . aircon still didnt work and door didnt lock . Didnt get much sleep and next morning checked out and moved to another hotel . I didnt really care about losing the money I had paid . . . . just wanted to get out of their . False advertising as their rooms are nothing like,487800339
"Sorry to say this place was a very poor standard . We arrived to wait for our rooms , bottom floor near the pool which we thought looking from the outside would be ok . Entering the rooms they reeked of cigarettes smell . Now anyone that doesn ' t smoke knows the smells not going to leave by using a deodorisers to mask the smell , which the staff truely believed it would . Also the fridge was not cleaned which turned me off . The Aircon barely worked in the rooms which made it a no brainier to leave . Our friends felt from the start driving into the place this place was already not looking like the photos . They did attempt to move us to the new rooms down the back which were twice as small with the same aircon problem . Some families just can ' t up and leave like we did so be warned the",484045580
"As the title of this review says , you get what you pay for at Bakung Beach . Be certain , this is NOT a luxury hotel , it is for travelers on a budget who want to spend their money on things other than their accommodation . It ' s position is great midway between Jalan Kartika and the beach just 5 minutes from the airport . Rooms are passable , air conditioned but the pool is great with a wet bar . I and my friends always stay here for a couple of days either side of a surfing trip to Java and it does the trick as it ' s cheap and cheerful but I would NOT bring my wife & kids on a family holiday as it ' s just too basic .",469745566
"This hotel was really cheap at $ 30 AU a night for 2 . Based on this it is a bargain and i would recommend ! Mostly clean , bathroom was a bit moldy but other than that all in the room was great . The pool needs maintenance , there are broken tiles with many sharp edges and the chlorine is SO strong that it burns your eyes and you cannot stay in the pool for longer than about 10 minutes due to the effects on your skin . ( Due to this I would not recommend it for little children ) Not a hotel if all you want to do is laze by the pool all day but perfect if you want to drop your bags and explore or shop and just come back to sleep . There are couple of great really cheap places to eat in the same little lane also . The juice bar 2 shops down towards the beach is a WINNER .",469737928
"We stay in this hotel 2 nights . The staff was very nice 👍 🏻 , the swimming pool it ' s amazing 😉 and the food very good . But our room was smelling bad and the bathroom was not the best one . The room are serviced every day . I still recommandes this hotel because is not so expensive and the staff are perfect .",468427364
"After landing in Kuta we were looking for something close to the airport , and that is about all this place has . The breakfast is not that great , probably best to get something on the street or in the mall 5m walk . Rooms are clean , but keep the A / C on to avoid mosquitos : P",449463370
"This was the worst hotel we stayed at during our trip . The only positive was the pool and possibly being next to Lippo plaza which also meant construction work , I ' m not talking about 9 - 5 construction either , I mean 3am chainsaws and hammer drills every . single . night . Also , if you want a towel for the shower then you ' ll be holding your breath . They take them when they clean your room and apparently bring them back at 5pm but most nights we had to call up around 9pm to get them to bring us some . Also , bad luck if you wanted to take your towel down to the pool as that ensured you wouldn ' t get a fresh one that day . Severe amount of mould in the bathroom too . Would not stay again .",440242532
"Its a budgeted resort with swimming pool , within walking distance from Kuta beach and Lipoto mall . Housekeeping team is good . Property is going through some renovation . AC in room is old and my remote didn ' t function well in last two days . Better not to switch it off at all . Complimentary breakfast is wholesome and Advisable to carry your own bedsheet . All in all , good value for money , location is great .",436490995
Currently at the pool doing this review . . For $ 30 per night . . Bargain ! ! . . . I will be back here that ' s for sure . Decent size pool and nice staff . Room was clean also . I haven ' t found an issue at all,421666154
"We booked the hotel for 3 weeks . It was 3 weeks of horror . Breakfast is minimum . Your chooses are toast ( guarded and need to be ordered ) strawberry jam or pineapple , 1 egg per person per day , Cold Balinese food . Watermelon and mango . Coffee , tea , orange juice . That ' s it . I was chocked ! We had booked a room for 3 . My daughters bed was later installed . 2 mattresses where put on the floor , and that was her bed . The sheets On the bedding was torn 9 out of 10 times . We only got 2 towels a day in the first week . I guess they didn ' t see it was a 3 persons room with the 3 beds . The phones in the room don ' t work at all . So in case of emergency you ' ll have to run up to reception for help . There where rats running around because the hotel had there own carnage storage . "" That ' s Bali """,400245105
"Nice and clean , air conditioned , cold fridge , friendly staff , spacious . Everything that you really need . We only stayed one night which was fine . We have been spoilt by the big resorts so we would not stay here for several days . Basic but good .",399009358
"This is my 3rd stay at Bakung Beach and definitely my last . Whilst you cannot complain about the price and location close to airport , the place really needs a little tender love and care . The rooms are big with comfortable bed . Shower area would fit 6 people but don ' t expect hot water , it is pretty hit or miss . Besides the flat TV , the furniture is outdated and should be consigned to the tip . The air conditioner works , however , I had difficulty sleeping from the vibrating notice of an adjoining room AC . Breki is very basic to the extent they ration you to 1 egg only . If you really want a good breakfast then walk next door to 5 star hotel and pay $ 15 . My main gripe with this hotel is the swimming pool . It ' s too deep , stinks of chlorine and the tiles walls and surrounds are green",378887527
"Lovely oasis between the busy streets of Kuta . Nice breakfast , swimming pool and relaxing area and wifi at the pool is not bad . No wifi available in the rooms and there are not enough beds at the pool to relax during the day . Rooms are simple but clean and with good airco",359207316
"Never would advise anyone on this Hotel . Linen very tired and grubby looking . No kettle or cups , coffee , tea facilities . Shower wet everything in the bathroom , keep lid down on toilet . Breakfast was very poor and uninteresting . Food was not covered and flies walking on the food . Wouldn ' t even think of eating at restaurant . Staff didn ' t seem very helpful . When we were there hotel frequented with more europeans than westerners . I know it was low priced and I have learnt my lesson . But still would say no at anyone thinking of staying here .",356693973
"2nd stay here in the past year and not much has changed . If you ' re on a budget this hotel is classic Bali . In a great location , friendly staff and adequate large rooms . Linen is old , towels cleaned daily and breakfast range is small but plentiful . If you ' re on a $ $ budget this is a great place to stay . It ' s not 5 star and could do with a lot of updating but this is what the charm of Bali used to be .",326172495
We booked the 3 room deal for our family trip . The four kids were in adjoining rooms and thoroughly enjoyed themselves . Breakfast was included and although limited in choice was fresh and kept full each day . The staff all seem to have worked there forever and you do get the impression your interupting them with any request through the front desk . Pool area was great but over chlorinated . Probably wouldn ' t book it again but budget wise couldn ' t fault the place .,318779413
"We were the only guests arriving that time . The staff ignored us by their conversation continuing together . After that no welcome just "" what do you want "" I replied I booked 2 rooms . Asked for floor room , our room was available 7pm ( checked in around 2 o ' clock ) We were given 202 and 305 . The staff who carried our suite cases upstairs were waiting for a "" tip "" , informed them we will give some money tomorrow morning . I know we always do tip this time we very very upset by the reception . They keep waiting . I know they do a good job gave them 100 . 000 Rp the next day . The room was great and the breakfast great .",310898974
"Our flight came in the middle of the night so we decided to stay somewhere nearby for our first few days in Bali . The price to stay here is fair , the grounds are beautiful , there is a nice swimming pool , and the room we had was downstairs in the corner but still quite nice . The atmosphere is very relaxed and peaceful , being just a few minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of the nearby beaches and shops in Kuta . Great place to stay for a few days in Kuta , may have to come back again before we fly out !",305795132
My daughter and I stayed for 10nights . Nice clean room . Very friendly staff . The WiFi was ok as it had moments where it was a little slow but down near the pool was great . Large and very deep pool . Sometimes a little bit over chlorinated but very clean . Where the hotel is located is in a quiet lane so very quiet at night . Only a 10 minute walk to Kutas main shops and beach . The hotel has a new shopping centre ( lippo mall ) at the end of the lane with a supermarket which has everything you could need . Already planning my next trip and will definitely stay there again,298476491
From the moment we arrived we knew we were on a winner . Clean comfortable rooms . We were originally given an upstairs room . . . after a few days requested a downstairs due to leg injury . . . . . not a problem . We were recommended Bakung by a family that have stayed here annually for over 25 years . The friendliness of staff is fantastic . . . alot we spoke to have been long term employees . We met a surprising number of people who have been staying here for years . . . and have heard on a number occasions this is the one constant in Bali with all the progress going . . . . this is not just for the budget traveller . Everything you require is a short walk away . More than happy to come back .,294579489

Stayed here in September 14 and returning November15 . I feel some reveiws very crictical . You have to realise this a budget hotel if you want luxury and a massive buffet breakfast go pay $ 300 a night somewhere else . Rooms were large clean and had comfy beds Breakfast cost about $ 2 a day when pre booked am \ nd is ample and if you ask they will cook bacon and eggs or omlette just ask its free just not in buffet . meals are cheap and tasty but range is limited . Large Bintangs 35000 rupiah ( 150000 at the $ 300 a night hotel ) Boat to go surf kuta reef etc 200m walk Supermarket and Lippo mall 200m walk taxi to Kuta $ 1 Best value in Bali,277990684
"This is the first time we tried a budget hotel and was pleasantly surprised with the Bakung Beach Hotel - especially after reading reviews . Seems a lot of people want 4 star accommodation , but only want to pay peanuts . Our room and bathroom was well used but clean . Furniture a bit rickety , but ok . The entry door had big gaps around it , but easily fixed as we always pack a roll of foam to block the gaps . You gotta be careful with mozzies these days . The staff were very friendly and helpful . There ' s a beautifully kept pool with a restaurant on the side . Cheap meals and drinks available . The hotel location is central to the rest of Kuta , with 100m walk to the Lippo Mall & supermarket , and 850m to the Centro Mall . The beach is only 200m away .

"First of all , the front desk staff hardly spoke any English . The pool has too much chlorine it , do not open you ' re eyes under the water ! Not much of a variety for breakfast . Fried noodles and fried chicken or fried rice every morning , you will need to order bacon or eggs from the kitchen as they do not have it on the buffet . The hotel is right next door to Lippo Mall . The rooms are not that big or spacious . we were located on the 3rd floor and we had a balcony with view of the garden . The shower was broken , the water was most of the time cold . The tiles in the rooms has brown stains on them . When staff came to clean the room , they usually leave the dirty cutlery outside of your room until the next day ! Do not use the hotels transport service ! So expensive for a 5mimute drive !",268192369
"Stayed here in September 2014 . Staff is very friendly , pool was nice and I liked the location - not in the busy city centre but in the outskirts in a quit street . The beds are very comfy and for what we paid for the room , I would definitely stay again .",264350300

"The hotel is good value for money . Rooms are clean and air conditioned . Staff friendly and not intrusive . Surf is close by to catch a boat to the reefs . TV satellite , wifi , and room service .

"Had a really late flight from Darwin , landed just before midnight , so didn ' t arrive until gone 1am . Reception was kind of awkward , at the top of some stairs , but a member of staff brought our luggage round to the side for us so we didn ' t have to haul it up the steps . Checked in quickly and within 10 mins , we were in our room . Our room was great . ( Super luxury compared to the hostels we ' d stayed in throughout Australia ! ) Big bathroom , cute little balcony , flat screen TV , little fridge . ( Always ask for non smoking when booking - people smoke EVERYWHERE in this country , including the hotel rooms ! ) Breakfast was good - different everyday . You get the basics like toast , tea and coffee , fruit etc , but there ' s also hot food . Rice , noodles , sausages in sauces , we even had battered fish",205598735
"I would never stay here again : 1 ) There is no pool ( being rebuilt until July ) 2 ) The front desk is very rude and charged me 20 , 000idr to CALL a taxi . 3 ) The doors between neighboring rooms are thin slats with large gaps so you can see into other peoples rooms ! ! ! ( Very creepy ) 4 ) Because of the thin doors and walls you can hear everything in the adjacent rooms , that means at 0500 we were woken by the family next to us talking and packing , literally we could hear every word they were saying . 5 ) It is expensive for this area of Kuta , we had much better rooms for 175000idr 6 ) The bathroom is terrible . But . . . It is right next to the lippo mall ( literally ) so you can go shopping if that is your thing . Stay elsewhere , big dissapointment .",201973091
"Room was spartan to say the least . Bed was decades old and uncomfortable and the sheets felt like plastic and were too small for the bed and came off all the time . The blankets were very old and scratchy . Bathroom was very dirty , with grime and mould building up between the tiles . Don ' t bother with the restaurant . We had dinner one night and nothing was as described and the quality of the food was absolutely awful . It took forever for our meals to arrive , and when they did , they were almost inedible . The pool area looked very nice , and the gardens were lovely at night .",183584869
We booked this hotel through a hotel website as we wanted to do our short holiday on the cheap and $ 30 a night including breakfast seemed perfect . The photos on the website looked reasonable so we were happy to book it in . We arrived at about 1am in the morning and went really greeted at all . We were shown to our room where nothing was explained and then the person left telling us we needed to take the voucher down for breakfast between 7 and 10am . The room next to us has their TV up to ridiculous levels and as the walls were paper thin there was no chance of us getting to sleep . They finally returned at about 3am but continued to make plenty of noise and they were then joined in the room by at least 3 other people partying on until at least 4am .

For 22 , 7 US Dollars per night , i get large , clean and comfort room , with the terrace on every room . The breakfast is also delicious although there are only two choices , toast and fried rice .

"Me and my partner have stayed her twice within the last 2 months . We are traveling around Asia and had two good last minute deals with this hotel . Our room was very spacious , but basic , everything we needed though , aircon and hot water .

The staff were very friendly and polite and helped us when we asked . There isa . Brilliant hypermarket just opened next to the hotel , it is amazing . As the breakfast was very basic , we decided to buy our own toast toppings , which was very cheap and made the breakfast better .",179872006
"We found the place to be a good base close to the airport due to the very early hour arrival time at Dempasar Airport . We were booked for 5 nights at the hotel . Staff and the security guard were on hand for a speedy room and luggage check in before we were off again on a 3 hour drive to another dive resort leaving excess baggage behind . The room with bathroom clean and spacious was on d ground floor , which made it convenient for us . Breakfast offered with d room was adequate but I found the taste of water required getting used to as it tasted like ORS . Better to have yr own mineral water supply . The hotel is well known as own arrangements for tours and outings was a breeze and pick up was on the dot . Lots of activities in d surrounding area including d beach was within",178230231
Stayed at this very poor excuse of a hotel from August 22 to 27 2013 . . . The room was basic and average . . fairly clean but the linen was gross . Breakfast was not fit for human consumption as far as I ' m concerned and looked disgusting . The staff were nice though except for one annoying bar person at the pool bar that kept harassing me to get tattoos from his brother . Do yourself a favour and spend and extra few bucks and stay somewhere else .,176982732
"I stayed here in November 2011 , the bar and restaurant is excellent , excellent pool . For the money these rooms cost you can ' t complain . It ' s what you ' d expect for the money , don ' t pay anymore than AU $ 35 a night with breakfast , i think you could barter them down a little more . Apparently they have refurbished rooms now , would like to try them out ! Only downfall is the location , too far too easily walk into the main entertainment district , you ' ll end up spending lots of money on taxis . Although taxis are cheap as chips in Bali , it still adds up . Am going back to Bali in August 2013 and was very tempted to stay at Bakung ' s again , but trying somewhere closer to my favourite area , Legian Rd / Poppies Lane 1 & 2 .

Had stayed at Bakung Beach for the last 10 years have just arrived to find that all the rooms have been updated with free wifi which works fantastic little bit of noise from the new shopping centre next door being built but for $ 30 a night one of the best places to stay in Tuban .

"We haven ' t stayed at Bakung Beach Resort , but are eagerly wanting to stay soon . The price and location of the Hotel is fantastic we have had a look on our last stay and are willing to give the Hotel a big thumbs up",706151171
"Cheapish hotel in great location if you want to be near airport , lippo mall and the beach . Nice pool and garden area if you like the old style hotel . However it is run down , For a night or twos stay may be OK but we stayed for 7 nights and the bed was uncomfortable , sheets were dirty and smelly so was the pillow , they really do need to buy new bedding . The cleaners were friendly but I didn ' t think breakfast was worth it and the staff weren ' t that friendly at all . The air con made a hideous noise and was just so / so in cooling ability . Fridge worked , toilet flushed sort of , lid broken , shower worked but yes as for most hotels that age and price there is mould in the shower which faces the toilet . Balcony was nice and the hotel itself was quite I thought until dogs start barking",684471197
"I was initially put into room 710 . The cleanliness of it was actually fine however the air con and fridge did not work . A maintenance guy came up to check everything and then left without doing anything . I called reception back and requested a new room . Although the manager didn ' t seem to thrilled about it , I was then moved to room 605 which was far superior . It looked like it had been renovated more recently . The room was spacious , comfy bed , clean linen , private balcony and the bathroom didn ' t have any mould . . . Check - in was very meh , I didn ' t really feel welcome at all and no one helped me with my luggage up three flights of stairs . The breakfast was very average , luke warm ' hot food ' with little variety . The gardens and pool look lovely but i didn ' t have time for a swim . . . I",673476860
"Wonderful hotel , close to the shopping mall and the big street with all the cute souvenir shops and cozy restaurants . The hotel is not expensive at all . beautiful room with lots of space . You ’ ll have your own bathroom as well . Mine wasn ’ t very clean though , when I arrived . Cleaning service isn ’ t the very best , but I didn ’ t have big problems with it . I truly loved my stay at Bakung Beach Resort and it was more than perfect to me . The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful . It felt like home .",669958751
What a crap place . Buggered up our rooms . Smelt of sewage until we were moved . Food was disgusting . No service and it looked like it needed a bloody good clean up . Definitely a place not stay at . Not a place I would recommend . The pool needed to be fixed up along with new pool chairs and tables . Pool towels were not supplied . Beds were not comfy . The staff need a good kick up the arse .,669648489
"Reasonable rooms with nice terrace , friendly people , good bed and sufficiently clean . Breakfast is very basic . It is near the airport and in the middle of the city , but you just don ' t notice it in the hotel . Courtyard full of green and there is even a swimming pool . Okay not super luxury all but still good . Good girl for the price you pay . . from now one I will start and finish here my vacations . .",635037169
"Positives : Beds , AC . ( Maybe got the lucky room in that regard ) Negatives : staff seemed to not care that much for the guests , didnt even show us to the room or help us carry out bags Only a tired lady in the reception and we arrived around 6pm . They did not maintain the hotel at all . It was very run down , rooms were probably pretty nice a couple of years ago . The bathroom was awful . Moldy drapes and water on the floor did not fall to the drain so it was constanly wet and smelled bad . Very disappointing . The pool area was badly lit , no lights in pool and was not very well cleaned . Pool bar had no staff attending to it the 2 days we stayed . Resturant also run down with staff that seemed tired of serving guests , except for 2 people who were nice . A young girl taking orders and",633372594

"By far the worst and filtiest hotel i ’ ve ever booked . Fungus and mold on the ceiling and wall , teared up sheets and towels , shower with icecold or bloodyhot water no inbetween , with no consistent flow , like somebody is pumping the water . Even when you dont pay much for the rooms , the least you can expect is clean rooms and clean sheets ( after a week they still didnt renewed them , i could tell by the stains , tears and smell ) . The worst thing of all , while we were out for an hour to lunch after we complained , they quickly painted over the mold on the ceiling ! ! See pic 2 and 8 . Though the manager was friendly and apologised , this hotel gave us the creeps . They offered us another room , but with such lack of hygiene we didnt even wanted to look . Who would have ? Never ever again .",565250884
"The hotel is not so far from the beach , however you need to walk a bit and not to get to the better beach on the surroundings . To get to the more popular beaches , with restaurants , surf lessons , street shopping and others you have to walk a lot . The best part of the hotel is the swimming pool , but the rooms are not the best . The shower has bad pressure but you have hot water , the breakfast is very simple but enough , the rooms are a little degraded but you have the simple conditions for a good stay for a few days . The hotel is not so far from Denpasar airport , however it is located on a dark road , with almost nothing on the close surroundings .",513902760

It was our last two nights in Bali and we have choose to stay at the Bakung Beach hotel . The ambience was good with the great pool . Even Beach was few minutes walking distance form the hotel . Those who wants to be close to the beach can book this resort .,506099272

I informed the receptionist but he told me to put the towel underneath the air - cond . They didn ' t rectify it until we check out . The wifi was super poor , we were not able to connect wifi from our room . I think they should improve the wifi speed as many of guests from foreign country and rely on wifi .",467123462

"Located close to the airport and the bustling streets of Kuta . The street leading from the Kartika Plaza mall to the hotel is pedestrians only , so your cab may have a difficult time finding the access road ( on the beach side ) . Rooms are clean , but basic .

My 4 week August 2016 stay at Bakung Beach Hotel was our second stay from our 2015 stay . The staff continue to be friendly helpful and happy . The accomodation and breakfast continue to be reasonable value but please guys fix fix fix the murky green pool water . On most days of that 4 weeks 2016 stay you could not see the bottom of the pool it was so murky . The water was also stinging mine and other guests eyes similar to our previous stay but at least then the water was clear . This was pointed out to the front desk staff on a number of occaisions . The water should be the normal clear ' blue ' color of any normal healthy pool . There were the standard number of guest on the pool sunlounges but very few swimming this time . The pool area and water quality are ( very obviously ) one of,415518511
I was a little disappointed visiting Bakung again . Whilst this is not a top hotel it has gone down hill since last time I visited . The good points was the clean linen and comfy bed and of course the price . On the negative side the breakfast was not as good as last time with quite a limited choice especially with fruit . The biggest disappointment was the state of the pool . It was the same colour as the diving pool in Rio . . . . . . green . The atmosphere was quite dull with the swim up bar not operational on our stay . Anyway for the price it is a viable choice for an overnight stay near the airport .,412963629
"Stayed for 6 nights in August . The staff are really friendly and helpful , about a 5 minute walk to the beach which was always quiet when i was there , 2 minute walk to Lipo Mall which has a supermarket and foodhall on the ground floor which was handy . Airport is about a 10 - 15 minute drive . The room had lcd / plasma TV with a good selection of english channels including the Australia + channel which is good if you like AFL . Aircon worked well . Big balcony , minibar , shower with hot water and good pressure , room cleaned everyday . The only small negatives was that my room was interconnecting with the room next door so i could hear the neighbours sometimes and its about a 20 minute walk to pubs and clubs on Legian street .",412608777
I am currently staying at the hotel for a short vacation in Bali . It ' s located very close to the airport so one may even walk from and to it . ( 2 . 5 km ) . The pool is really nice and open till 11pm . I also suggest getting the breakfast because it offers a good variety of dishes . The staff is nice and helpful and the rooms are meeting the expectations . There is wifi around the pool for people who want to work and relax at the same time,412510548

"Spent 1 night here , not out of choice . Arrived at midnight , supposed to be picked up by the hotel . But when I arrived NO ONE WAS THERE TO PICK ME UP and I had no where else to go . Floors were sticky , door had a big gap between the door and the wall . The bathroom felt mouldy and yuck . Did not even use it . No in room dining . Aircon was a hit and miss . The room had no internet , I had to be right beside the pool to use the Internet . Worst part was there was no safe in the room . Hated every second here and would never go back .",409917693
This was my 2nd stay here . Spacious rooms friendly staff nice pool . I like the area . So close to LippoMall . Omelets at breakfast are really good . We had 4 nights . Very happy . They have cable TV air conditioning works well . Room serviced daily water each day .,405943768

"The entrance to the reception is a bit different : you have to take two stairs to do this . But the people are friendly an helpful in many ways . The room we had was large and clean .

Big balcony and adequate airconditioning . The hotel is situated 5 minutes walk from the beach , 2 minutes from the start of the buzzing main street with restaurants and 5 minutes walk from the first "" warung "" , the indonesian low profile restaurants .

The hot water contiuously goes from scalding to cold continuously without warning . The bed went from two sheets to one , then two singles draped across a bare stained mattress that you end up sleeping on because the sheets are overlapped and too small .

I had a pleasant holiday at the Bakung in February 2015 for 15 days . Unfortunately it has taken me this long to sit and pop my review in due to contracting Dengue Fever during this holiday . I feel the water features and the area had something to do with this . I don ' t think I would stay at a hotel which has a pond again if I ever do return to beautiful Bali . It has been a whole year since being in paradise ! ! Anyway enough about me . . the staff here are just beautiful . Breakfast is really enjoyable with a nice selection . The pool is sunny most of the day and sparkling clean . My only complaint about the pool is they need to clean more regularly around the tiles of the swim up bar as it gets a bit dirty around the water level . Rooms are aged but lovely and clean as is the linen .,365890115

The next morning we went for breakfast which was only an extra £ 2 a day for the both of us we only ate in there the first day . There was nothing to offer , we only ate toast that morning . There was no cereal or egg , bacon , tomatoes , beans ect that you would expect to find in a buffet style breakfast . The only option was boiled rice and curry - not what we wanted at 8am ! !

The breakfast was very poor and they were more concerned with me not presenting my breakfast voucher . tiles in pool quite broken and sharp I ended up checking out and going elsewhere for the same price and a lot my pleasant .

Perfect location from kuta beach and airport . Good price . Good facilities but not with the towel . I checked in at 12 am and they gave the towel maybe at 6 pm . The hotel behind the lippo mall so it will be easy to spend time for a solo traveller,274923658
"I have stayed at this hotel before mainly due to its close distance to airport . Bali traffic can be a nightmare and if you are at the northern end of Kuta , Legian or seminak it is impossible to say how . Long will it take to get to the airport . Depending on the time of day it could take 1 to 2 hours . I have heard stories of 3 hours . Bakung is only a short drive to the airy so you can get there quickly . The hotel is set off the Main Street so it is reasonably quiete . Rooms are basic but will meet your needs , flat TV , big showere Nd comfortable bed . Pool is too deep and over chlorinated . Breakfast is basis but meals and cocktails very reasonably priced . There is large shopping centre on the corner but overpriced . You can walk to the beach front in 5 minutes and along the main Kuta",269825412

Bathroom water smelt but this is the water . Rooms were very basic and if you are a non - smoker then we would suggest you get a non - smoking area away from smokers as this made us feel quite ill .

The hotel is quite ok . only 100m from beach but it is quite hidden . need to ask for directions to the beach . we got a clean and spacious room with a balcony which overlook the garden . it came with a simple breakfast which was fine good enough . they could improve by providing mosquito spray or something as there a lot at night in the room even though the doors and windows were shut all the time . water pressure in the bathroom could also be improved . other then that we had a good stay .,239873433

"We booked in advance and requested single beds in a ground floor room ( 2 ladies travelling together ) . We arrived to a double bed upstairs . The pool was way too warm and not at all refreshing after a hot day out . Then on day 3 of our stay the pool turned turned green . Nobody could tell us when it would be fixed and didn ' t seem at all concerned They didn ' t stop people swimming even though it was highly likely you could get amoebic meningitis if the water went up your nose . We departed after three days of no swimming . Not happy . Also they forgot to give us towels every single day . How hard is it ? On a positive note , the breakfast was simple but good .

The beach is a short stroll down the lane ; a walkway that takes you all the way to Kuta with access to most shopping venues is a pleasant place for walk or just to watch the beautiful Bali sunsets .

The cons - dirty bathroom - rusty pipes - bad water smell - breakfast quality and variety I was unsure if to go 2 or 3 stars , on the last morning they forgot my omelette and then they changed the ( please make my room ) to do not disturb . The staff are lovely and at the price you can launch yourself into Kuta . Pool area is brilliant and bintang was 25 , 000 for small and 35 , 000 for large so vary well priced !",235337008
"Money well spent ! The rooms are cleaned every day to some point . We would go out and come back to a made bed and new towels , plus they give waterbottles for free everyday . Wifi is ok but a bit slow sometimes . The pool area is great but i noticed my hair gets dirty after being in the pool so its probably not very clean . The bed wasn ' t very soft and comfy .

"We spent our last night in Bali at Bakungs Beach Hotel , and unfortunately it was a bad experience . While the rooms were clean and had AC , we felt very poorly treated by the entire staff . They all acted like we were not guests but rather pesks , and didn ' t respond to our "" pleases "" and "" thank yous "" ( we ' re a pretty low maintenance group ) . Additionally , we were asked to pay 50 , 000 Rph for the buffet breakfast ( included with some rooms ) , but the offerings were so meager I didn ' t want to pay any money for them at all . Additionally , the pool was under construction and there were no safes in the rooms as advertised . While the hotel is on an alleyway , it runs along a strip mall filled road that ' s pretty frustrating to walk along . Even just as a stayover prior to a flight out of the",200182150
"I stayed in this hotel only for 2 nights with my friend . We looked into the Booking review and it was not too bad . But when we arrived at our room it was terrible , we asked a room for non smokers and guess what cigarettes butts in the bathroom . The sink was clogged and there was no curtains for the shower . We asked for another room , but they said that there was no room available . So they promissed to do the maintenance and a proper cleaning in the room . If you are only worried about the location this is an average hotel , but for everything else I would not recommend this hotel .",196928042
"stayed here for 2 nights in a standard room . we choose a budget hotel as we were going to be out for most o the days and only needed a place to rest . In saying that the hotel is old style with nice manicured gardens , staff are friendly . the standard rooms are just that . there were no toiletries provided only 2 bars of soap . the breakfast was shocking and had stomach aches after eating . A new mall is located next door with a hypermarket there with everything you will need . Although the hotel is not central you can walk or take a short taxi ride in . the street has a few massage places and shops selling knick knacks . Overalll I would spend a few extra dollars and stay somewhere a bit more upmarket .",191697636
"We stayed for 4 nights here . Our room was fine but it lacked natural light as it was in a position that literally avoided all sunlight ! The staff were friendly and welcoming and would always say hello . Our room looked little like the management pictures that it displays , with those 1960s itchy orange / brown blankets on the bed . The blanket also had hair stuck to it which was not mine or my boyfriend ' s and this made me feel quite uncomfortable ! The rest of the room was okay though and had a very large bathroom but it was tile from top to bottom and was also a bit dated like the blankets . There was a nice terrace outside our room with chairs and a table and also a drying rack . The pool was refreshing but it really does need refurbishment as lots of the tiles are loose and",190934414
"Upon arriving at the hotel around midnight I was greeted by friendly staff , although poor English ( doesnt bother me though ) , the lobby area gave a great first impression - clean and well presented . The hotel exterior , although dated and a little run down , had a traditional Balinese feel about it , and the gardens looked maintained enough . The pool was clean and I did see a few small groups hanging around who seemed to be enjoying themselves . The standard room I was allocated on the other hand , was far from pleasing . The towels in the bathroom were badly worn with threads hanging off everywhere and covered in stains . The sheets had a few small tears and stains as well . Although , when the room was serviced the following day , I was provided with much cleaner and fresher linen . No",180038621
"Stayed for 2 nights before going to Lombok . Rooms basic but clean . Linens and fridge clean . Staff friendly and helpful . Continental breakfast adequate - Breads , fruit and juice and 2 hot dishes - the Bali coffee was the best we had in our 3 week trip ! In easy walking distance to lots of restaurants and very close the beach . The new Tuban Hypermarket is only a 2 minute walk . Only drawback to this hotel was the broken pool tiles in the large pool . This put me off swimming as I did not want to risk a cut at the start of our holiday .",176442126
I stayed here for the second time in June . I was really happy to see they are renovating the hotel and things have changed a little . I love this little hotel value for money do cheap and the service is gret and always with a bit of cheekiness and a smile love the ladies gorgeous people and agung who is so cheeky but entertaining I will be staying here again and again ! ! ! ! !,164990291
"Bakung has always been our Bali hotel . We had a break from Bali for 15 years but when we went back last June , it was as though we had only been away for a year . True the hotel needs an upgrade but like all things in Bali changes are always on the move . The staff , including the kitchen staff , will make your stay memorable . Stay at Bakung , enjoy the shopping , the location , & book in for next time . Andy & Elaine .",149541511
Look this hotel was cheap but we didn ' t spend much time in the room . Our phone didn ' t work and the shower was awful . But we did the holiday cheap . So as the saying goes you get what you pay for . Pool was a nice area gardens were pretty beds comfortable room nice bathroom needs work not the cleanest . If you want to do it on a budget it ' s live able staff are friendly . The dark alley out the front at night was my only concern walking back alone was a little daunting,138376431
I ' ve stayed at Bakungs on a short visit which thankgod was only a one night stay . This hotel is old and dirty . On a second visit i stayed here but only for a few hours as i had a long wait before my flight and for $ 40 i didnt mind so much as i only wanted to use the shower and have some where cool to relax for a few hours . This is probably the only time i would reccomend for anyone to try out Bakungs . A few hours tops ! Any longer go some where else you will find better .,129278205
"We stayed 3 nights here from 1st of April and I think we made a mistake . The room was very old , the bathroom looked much older than the room and the wall next to the building was falling apart . If you where staying on the porch you had nothing to see nice . The price was non - negotiable and in my opinion was high for what they offer . The location is not good but it ' s quiet . The pool was old but the water was very good for swimming . The breakfast it ' s ok . I think we are not coming back at this hotel being the worst we ever stayed in Bali and in the same time one of the most expensive one .",127394269
Towels and sheets grey if your lucky they are clean ! No room account and rooms airconditioner leaked consistently definitely not where I will go again,117058975
