What I loved most was all the staff that works that Melia, each one of them are so friendly and kind, and as a collective, they've made our stay at the resort 200% better, and a special mention to a few that we've interact with:  Ian - he initially took us on the Uluwatu Temple excursion and we were so impressed by his enthusiasm as he was explaining about the temple during the bus ride there. During the excursion, he was always offering to help us take photos and was very willing to answer our questions along the way. The very next day, we attended a couple of water activities session that Ian also hosted, water",

We booked The Level and all inclusive which was well worth it. We came across people who upgraded whilst there because the food and drink wasn\u2019t cheap. We liked the separate Level pool, the staff here were so attentive but not overbearing, nothing was too much trouble and they even cleaned everyone\u2019s glasses each day!  We had a 2 storey family room which was fine, although the stairs were painful to walk on in bare feet. The toiletries and snacks were changed every day and it was kept clean. Room service was also included (bonus!) The only niggle would be the lack of variety on the menus and the constant hassle by beach sellers.  The staff",

After 2 nights we asked to be moved as our suite was at the very far end of the resort and my husband has a bad knee. We were given the opportunity to upgrade to a lagoon access suite, mid sections. Boy best decision ever. The better location really helped a lot, but it was being able to open your doors, take 4 steps and sink into the cool and pristine waters of the lagoon pool, that took our experience from average to fantastic.   Our only complaint, which others have commented on, is their breakfast. It is lack luster, lacks variety, and could be so much better. None of the toasters worked properly, the scrambled eggs at the buffet were of the powered kind (although you could ask for them to be made",

But everything else was disappointing.   Food and beverages are extremely expensive when you don\u2019t book the all inclusive package. The food was very average despite having 4 restaurants in the resort. Buffet breakfast options were lacking and the food was pretty much the same at every outlet. Room service would take forever to arrive and they were missing basic items like herbal tea. Only 2 small complimentary bottles of water provided everyday and if you wanted to purchase any additional bottled water, it was over $6 AUD for a 600ml bottle.  Not a lot of activities or experiences available except for kids",

The staff are lovely and cannot do enough for you aside from some minor issues detailed below . Communication is a little bit lacking in terms of what is happening and then responding to you, which I do think would improve things. However, overall, this is definitely a five star in terms of the layout, cleanliness, facilities and food.  I would recommended and certainly return .   Laguna room is worth the upgrade to swim out into the pool it really was magical and with room service included breakfast or dinner by the pool was a bonus.   Room service and mini bar included in all inclusive lovely touch - quick and nice selection too . All inclusive worth while as all items provided making",

We stayed in a lagoon pool access suite with the \u2018level\u2019 access.  Was amazing to be able to sit in a recliner at the back of your room and then drop into the pool directly off your room. This pool is only for those with off room lagoon access and those family rooms that have chosen the \u2018level\u2019 upgrade. Sometimes, the only down side was that rooms above saw this quiet pool below and decided that it was a great option for all their kids away from the main pools. Staff were ok about asking people, but also don\u2019t want to upset anybody. Any issue though, they were quick to respond.  The \u2018level\u2019 access was also well worth the extra $$, especially",

That said, there were a few concerning issues that we brought to the resorts attention and hope they will be addressed.  Foremost was the lack of standards around the pool. We saw guests eating and drinking while standing in the pool. We also observed a guest take their baby for a swim without a nappy. While nothing untoward occurred at the time, we couldn't help but think of the ramifications of people dropping their food in the pool or the baby reliving themselves in the pool. We had hoped that the pool staff might have intervened but they didn't, perhaps out of fear of offending the hard earned guests?  While on the beach, we saw staff diligently sweeping",

The room was beautifully appointed and had all we need.  We chose to upgrade to be Level guests.  This was just perfect!  It meant the use of an exclusive Level pool and beach area.  For us travelling in the school holidays, the Level Pool did not have children in it and was quiet and peaceful as was the beach area.  The actual resort is so luxurious.

One thing that was always outstanding is the hospitality by the hotel staffs. They're genuinely nice and provide their best service. Shoutouts to Ibu Sagung, Pak Karta at the breakfast El Patio restaurant who are very friendly, and also Pak Sumartha who checks around with the guests if everything is alright with their stay.

Quite a few people have mentioned the bathrooms and the over the bath showers. Even though I\u2019m quite short our son is a lot taller and he struggled with it.  The hotel itself is extremely well maintained and you always see staff busying themselves around.   What really stood out for us was the staff.

He would ask us the day before if there was any particular dish we would like to have made for us and then prepared the meals strictly avoiding any possible gluten contamination, even using dedicated pots and pans etc. He made our rice and noodles extra spicy the way we like it, even made us banana pancakes which were the best I have ever tasted! He was so lovely and accommodating. He genuinely cares and always went above and beyond to ensure every meal was a delight, yet so diligent as to not make him sick. Our overall stay was amazing. Would definitely stay here again.",

The hotel service was excellent, we had only breakfast but there were a great number of choices which we could eat from. The fascilities were also very great. The most suprising thing was that the hotel crew was really really nice, always smiling. The room service like cleaning and maintaning was very profound, especially our cleaning lady, Desak, who always did a very prominent job. We are very thankful for her and the whole hotel stuff.",

The staff are also very attentive, always polite but can be very very slow during service.   The food in the hotel is seriously below average, lunch menus in beach restaurant and main restaurant is the same as the dinner menu and does not change.   Food often arrives cold, my \u2018wagyu\u2019 steak in the tapas restaurant was something Ive never witnessed or tasted before, disgraceful.

To give our son some privacy we booked one of the LEVEL family suites with connecting doors. These suites consist of two separate rooms with a connecting door.

The large, well manicured property itself is gorgeous and there are many activities - paddle boarding, badminton, kidzone etc - available, most for free and some at a small cost. Because the property is so large, even though the hotel was teeming with guests for New Year's there were no issues with crowding and the atmosphere was very pleasant and felt covid-safe. The hotel was very festive, with delightful Xmas decorations and a New Years meal and other events on offer.

We are so glad we did this as we were able to access the adult pool and a different breakfast area.  We also upgraded to all inclusive. Which was the best thing we did. There are a lot of restaurants and bars that have closed around the area due to Covid. I hope they open up soon.  The all inclusive allowed us to have a choice of 5 restaurants which were all good and drinks. Room service was great where we could order anything 24 hours a day. The package also included daily bike hire, paddle boarding, kayaking and a discount for the Spa. We found it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive directly with the hotel rather than with the tour operator.   The rooms are getting a bit dated hence my",

We had a ground floor pool access junior suite and it was great.  We went on a B & B package which allowed us to eat locally at restaurants and warungs within walking distance.   The only downside of being in the Nusa Dua areas was that it took ages to get to see the main tourist attractions due to the traffic.

You'll empty it around 4 times a day but it makes the room experience a lot better.  Get the 'cabrio west' excision where you travel NW to a temple in an open top 1970s VW car (vw thingy..

We have stayed in the family room a couple of times previously and this is good up to two children, you do get a bit of privacy as the main room is on the upper level of a studio apartment. The hotel itself is exceptional, the grounds. pools, the food and the staff. We have stayed at a couple of different hotels on this tourist section of Nusa Dua and the Melia is by far the better one for us. As an added bonus, if you become a Melia Rewards member and work your way up. there are some good discounts to be had..... If you want to eat outside of the hotel, lots of local restaurants that will pick you up and drop you off for free. ",

Stayed at Melia Resort and booked a junior suite, however upgraded to a villa at expense as junior suite was dark, dated and had limited space. It was two levels with a steep stair case to the bedroom. The consierge were helpful when we requested the upgrade and the villa was spacious with private pool and courtyard. The villa was well serviced and included level 1 access allowing ala carte breakfast, cocktails and canapes at night and access to better beach front and pool. The staff on the whole were friendly and attentive. Breakfast was good, but otherwise meals were expensive and only adequate so we ate out at the plentiful local restaurants. I would go back again but only book the more",

Whilst I tend to agree with other reviews that the resort is slightly aged and family rooms dark, this was 100% made up by the staff who were kind, friendly and went over and above their jobs. This was especially the case at the kids club and activity centre where the staff were exceptional. Alep in particular was so kind to our children by playing with them, taking them to the futsal and basketball courts and off for bike rides - they formed a beautiful friendship that I know our kids will treasure.   Food was ok - we liked the beachside restaurant the best and I would advise to go all inclusive as it was quite pricey (although comparable to other",

We stayed in a Family Suite, having also thought about the idea of getting a Lagoon Room but the Family Suite is a better option with kids in my opinion.

The kids club was also a standout. Tya, Dani, Aci, Sasih, Dewi, Glaney and Maria are amazing.

It's a great place to just switch off and do absolutely nothing!   The staff are super nice, pleasant, always smiling and will greet you when you walk by. When you first arrive at the resort, they will sound a gong to welcome you. They will even give you a welcome juice when you're checking in at the reception!   At breakfast time, there will be someone playing the gamelan outside the coffee house, in the evening, there's a pianist who will play the piano at the lobby. So you generally feel very relaxed, chill and safe.   The general environment is clean but could be better as it is a big place and pockets do",

Miss Dayude gave us a tour of the resort, explaining the various activities available at the hotel, many of which are free of charge.  She highlighted the live band playing at the Sateria Beachside Restaurant, which we did check out when we had drinks at the Beachside Restaurant.

Staff were slow to serve if they weren\u2019t being tipped in the beach bar.

Nice kids club, several choices for restaurants although quite pricey vs local restaurants outside the resort. Your restaurant bill will be high if you have all your meals at the resort. The beach is nice but due to high/low tide there are some hours during the day when swimming is not really possible. Beach and water were very clean. It's worth to upgrade to LEVEL package if you want to enjoy adult only pool, fancier breakfast, tea time and cocktail hour. The resort was built in the 80's and has a great location on Nusa Dua beach. The age is felt in the living quarters and rooms are not really 5 stars, but the grounds and facilities/beach make up for it. Overall highly recommended. ",

Tide can make swimming from the beach a tad awkward as a ya quite shallow but ideal for kids but some of the best beaches in Bali are only a 15 minute walk",

The service with the Level upgrade is second to none.   We arrived at the hotel to be taken to the bar area (not reception, as we had the level) and were greeted by Yudi. He dealt with our check in for us whilst getting us a personalised coconut refreshing drink then drinks from the bar. He then checked our rooms were ready and took us to our rooms. We were a party of 6 adults and had 3 rooms all next door to each other. The level junior suites were fantastic.   We ate in all the restaurants and all were excellent for quality and service. The bars were all excellent. We never used the level pool as there aren't many beds round there",

The rooms were a little bit dated and  dark ,and the dining options for dinner were a little disappointing for  variety for 5 star standard after a couple of days.

The beach, the bars and the pool were gorgeous and the included breakfast was so plentiful, heaps to chose from. A must to get breakfast included. The rooms were really cool which gave us respite from the heat. The only draw backs were: 1.  The pool was closed at 7pm, which was a shame as we wanted to be able to cool off after a night out.  2. And of course the meals and drinks were expensive (compared to the other places we had visited in Seminyak & Ubud) - we ended up buying drinks outside the resort and brining them back to our room and just grabbed a couple to drink  sitting around the pool.  3.

There was usually just one or two vegetarian options. I survived on pizza and pasta for 6 days.  The pizzas were nice though but pasta okay.  The room was looking tired and this is despite me booking an upgrade.  When I asked for a late checkout they wanted to charge me $15 per hour and this is despite me pointing out about the food.

The sofa bed converted to a twin bed and is comfortable.   Plenty of sitting areas around the property and the pools.  We selected the all inclusive plan which was the best decision, food were abundance and delicious, the plan even included most alcoholic drinks,  the Sakura Japanese restaurant has some of the most delicious Japanese dishes.  Since we spent the Xmas there they have included a special Christmas Eve dinner and a Christmas Day brunch, which we enjoyed very much. ",

        "comment": "We had five wonderful nights here as a couple without children in a Junior Lagoon Access Room.  Pros: Super friendly staff who absolutely cannot do enough to help you. Lovely food in all the restaurants and cocktails  - we were All Inclusive. The grounds were beautifully maintained. The yoga in the mornings was perfect and my husband was impressed with the equipment in the gym. Our Lagoon Pool Room was wonderful - huge bathroom, our own little deck and lagoon pool access made us feel very spoiled. The hotel is located in Nusa Dua  so a great place  for morning walks along the beachfront and on the footpaths outside the hotel. The hotel is an easy walk to Bali Collection (which is not quite fully open to pre-covid times.) Cons: This is a very kid friendly resort which is awesome",

In a lot of cases, customers including ourselves are waiting 45 minutes for a drinks service and when we do get it, staff are confused and serving incorrect/incomplete orders. There\u2019s a very clear lack of experience and an inefficient service. I\u2019ve raised this with the hotel management who seem unconcerned and thanked me for being this to their attention, but have done nothing to rectify it.   To top it all off, whilst sitting to lunch service this afternoon, the hotel have arranged for poison to be sprayed around the patio area which is incredibly strong smelling and clearly harmful",

We had taken up the Level package.  On arrival, we were warmly greeted and ushered to the Level lounge for our check in process. Ari was the Level personnel who assisted us. We truly enjoyed her services thru our entire stay. Never without a smile.   We were upgraded to The Level Lagoon Access Junior Suite (we had initially booked a family room). The Junior Suite was less ideal for my family given that my kids had to sleep on a sofa bed vs the proper beds in the family room. But having direct access to the pool from the room was a tad too appealing for them.  Thru the entire stay, it was apparent that the",

Across from the pool was a lawned area with day beds and a bar, which made it feel like a private resort. Food at the various restaurants was good, but the standout meal was at the Japanese restaurant.   There are many areas of the resort which are set up for rest and relaxation, including day beds on the beach which was a nice way to spend the afternoon accompanied with a cocktail.  The resort grounds are extensive, pristine and beautiful. Despite the Meli\u00e1 being a large resort, all the staff make themselves available to you , and offer assistance in order to ensure you have a wonderful stay. Recommended",

Melia Bali is based in Nusa Dua which really quiet and relaxing area, very clean and safe. The whole Bali island is safe but as soon as you come out of Nusa Dua you'll see how crazy busy is the island, especially the traffic, it's like organised mess that somehow seems to work. Comparing to all that Nusa Dua is like a small piece of paradise. The hotel has lovely gardens and massive swimming pool. It also has private beach that is well maintained and clean, its white sandy beach with clear turquoise water. You can walk along the beach for miles to other 5*star hotels that are also on the seafront. The hotel offers bicycles and vast",

Had a choice of our own pool or main pool.  Housekeeping was amazing as it was always done by 1 pm and it was done so so well, very clean and neat.  Beach restaurents and bars and el patio lunch was really good and wasn't expensive.  All staffs were very very friendly and would go their way to do anything for you.  Loved the grounds in melia Bali and is very very well catered for families with children.  We would recommend melia bali to anyone who will be visiting bali.  ",

The most impressive from Melia is the kids club. The place is very neat and clean, the activities are very fun for the kids and the staffs are very nice. Thanks to Ibu Sasih and Miss Aci, both of you made the kids are very enjoy to spend their time at the kids club.

As soon as he saw us he whipped them up and delivered to our table. Amazing service and nerves settled!   The kids club at Melia was our sons highlight! The ladies are so welcoming and friendly. It was like he instantly had a whole team of Aunties. They had great communication with us. We utilised the baby sitting service so we could enjoy some nights out. Maria went above and beyond, swapping her shift so she could babysit for us on our final night. Thank you",

We stay in family suite, the hallway to our room looks old and scary, the room is well maintained but its clearly shown its age, the furniture, bathroom, etc is old. The tv also quite old too, not smart tv.   Breakfast is good to average, not excellent.   Service hospitality is mixed, they have rules that 14 year old kid is count as adult and have to pay extra charges for room fees, ehem we have stayed in various 5 star hotel in bali and never encounter any problems whatsoever, and we never get warned or told it to our face like that.

But since we found it, we didn\u2019t want to stay anywhere else. The first time when we booked Melia Bali was only for a week and we end up staying 2 months (Yes, this is how much we loved it!). The main reason was the fantastic Kids Club, which offers 12 hours care for your kids with a new activity every hour. My 8 yo daughter completely loves it and couldn\u2019t wait to go there every day, so we were all able to have a Real vacation, kid\u2019s happily playing while grown ups get to relax by the pool and",

If you are over 6 feet tool, then you  can\u2019t even stand up properly as your head hits the ceiling. Very little pressure with the shower aswell.  Paying $11 AUD for a small Bintang at the bar near Lobby is a joke.

Big thanks to Resti, Pringga, Juli, Oka and Angga who looked after us so well and really made our trip. Can't wait to see them again when we head back next year!   Would definitely recommend purchasing the Level option and all-inclusive. The resort has some gluten free options and we were told they are working towards providing more. We found the best approach (as a coeliac) was to talk directly with the chefs. At El Patio restaurant the chefs were more than happy to point out",

There are bikes you can hire for and hour and ride them outside of the hotel. There is a tennis court, archery and a farm located at the back of the main hotel. The staff are very helpful and funny as they have a lifeguard for the pool and people to go in the pool and play stuff like basket ball. The food is excellent with a breakfast buffet every morning and then drinks on them side of the pool. There are manny restaurants that you can try each with a different menu. I recommend that if you come to Bali you go to Meli\u00e3 Bali.",

Travelling with my brother, both adults over 30, we were a bit apprehensive about this, as our experience with such hotels are that they are great when you have kids, but underwhelming when you do not want to sit still and a have a minimum of new impressions. We did not go for the level nor all inclusive, as we wanted to mainly use the hotel as a base and travel around other places during the day.  The hotel itself is very nice, although bearing some signs that the ongoing renovations are necessary. Our room was clean, with frequent visits from house cleaning, and with the little time we spent inside very much suited our needs. The laundry service was",

I\u2019ve been completely overwhelmed by the kindness, generosity and genuine caring shown by everyone who works at this hotel. For the few nights I stayed in a swim up room, it was spacious, comfortable, if a little far away from everything. Swimming in the evening from the deck was great.  For the last week I stayed in a pool villa and I have no words to describe how fantastic the experience was - I don\u2019t want to leave! The breakfast is the highlight for me, both the buffet and the Level access only. Out of this world amazing and Chef Bayu is outstanding.

We travelled with teens and I think this hotel is definitely geared for little kids (actually great for little kids) but if you want a more relaxed feel around the pool you won\u2019t find it here. Aqua aerobics was fun, the beachfront was beautiful to relax on and the dinner at the beach restaurant definitely felt like you were on a tropical Balinese holiday. I think for our family or for couples there are much better choices in ND but if you have little ones I think you would be happy here.",

The environment of the hotel is beautiful, with lots of greenery in the garden. The room was a bit old but very clean and comfortable. All the staff were super nice and friendly to make sure we have the best experience. The beach was alright, the water was quite shallow compared to other beaches we've been to as well, especially during low tide, so very suitable for young children. The food at the restaurants were all amazing, some said that the prices were too high but we found them quite reasonable for a luxury resort. There were also a lot of activities offered such as yoga and bicycle rental, so you'd never get bored",

The pool and grounds were fantastic, and the kids loved the large pool - we sat in a different location every day and our favourite was the little island area in the middle.

From the moment we arrived, we were treated like Royalty, nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff who looked after us for the entire time we stayed at Melia.  The whole environment of the Melia at Nusa Dua was awesome, our room was perfect, with access to the Lagoon pool and cocktail bar from our room.  The 5 restaurants were great, and we especially enjoyed the facilities afforded to us a Level guests:  private access to beach and pool, cocktails in the Level Lounge, and so much more.  I cannot stress how wonderful the staff at Melia were, we wanted for nothing and they made us feel so welcome.  A special shout out must be given to our personal Concierge Yudi, and",

The staff was more than polite, the \"Level\" experience was fabulus, offering us the perfect alla cart menu breakfast at Sorrento restaurant + evening coctails before dinner (I am expecting the recipy of the Gin Bnt - if I remember well the name) ecc. I won't forget the food at the hotel's restaurants- we dine outside the hotel just once and it wasn't satisfying as in Melia. Complimenti to the Chefs. The big tropical gardens,  the pools, the squirrels coming up to the 4th floor during the day set a magic scenery. If the journey to Bali wasn't so long from Greece, I would go there  every year and at the same hotel. Very relaxing place.  Thank you",

We have stayed at a number of all inclusive resorts in Nusa Dua but this is hands down the best All-Inclusive Resort in Bali. When shopping for All Inclusive - Check the Fine Print. This resort gives you 6 different restaurant options and they are all next Level. I have had the best Japanese and Indonesian Cuisine here EVER. You can order a meal or a drink by the pool or just get an ice cream or s steak on the beach. The service is always good and the staff will meet just about any request you may have. If you are celebrating an occasion, they make you feel super special. It is a beautiful morning pushbike ride and its walking distance",

The hotel and the rooms have a strong Balinese influence, the gardens are always lush and immaculately maintained as well as the pool and beach areas. We enjoyed the attention from the Level staff who, while looking after us so well,  were always fun to be around.",

This can be a little frustrating when you want to go and eat elsewhere (If you aren't there with all inclusive). The staff is very helpful and kind and the pool area and the surroundings are very nicely maintained. The breakfast was varied and tasty. the prices for lunch or dinner are  expensive compared to other restaurants. The room was clean, we really enjoyed the 2 bathroom areas. It's a good place if just want to relax. The spa area is very nice.",

On reading reviews we noticed The Level being mentioned alot and found a number of extras that you got with this offer. So we went for it and we were extremely happy we did.  Unbelievably happy.  On arrival we were taken to an air conditioned room and given a glass of bubbly while they looked after booking us in.  Then we were offered nibbles to have which coincided with the 2 hour happy hour that you get every night as part of this deal. Our holiday was blowing us away and we had only just arrived!!  Our room was two level and it was beautiful. Very spacious.  We had fruit and water delivered everyday. Our 4 poster bed was very comfy as were our pillows.

Only stopped for 4 nights on our way back from Australia. Bad points: All 4 rooms we were shown had a damp musty smell. Very slow service, best go to the Bar and get your own.  Food ok if you were a meat eater. When asked for a vegetarian option, we were shown just vegetables. There were no complete balanced vegetarian meals to include protein.  The free hire bikes were badly maintained, tyres almost flat and brakes not adjusted correctly. Cheap, uncomfortable loungers by the pool and beach. Beach full of plastic litter. Guest relations manager very unsympathetic,  only offered a foot massage and a day at the 'exclusive' pool",

The all inclusive deal is so good, having the choice of restaurants was great and the fact the kids could get drinks and ice-cream all day made them very happy! The entertainment every day was great for young children and older children.  The only negative was the rooms could do with a refurb and we had to ask for them to be re-cleaned.  The sheets seemed damp but I think it\u2019s just the rooms that were damp! The resort made up for these small things and we would go again and also recommend Melia to other families.  ",

Luckily we recorded the noise as the guest relations tried to deny it. Apparently we were not the only guests to complain but the management tried to fob us off.  Quality of food and drinks was very good but was let down by poor choice and poor service in the restaurants and on the beach front deck area.

Our room have direct access to the lagoon pool which is perfect for the kids as they can swim anytime from the room. During our stay there, hotel guest capacity still very low so they only open 1 restaurant near the beach. Since not many people stay at the hotel, we utilize our time to explore and enjoying the beach as like our private beach.overall we enjoy ourtime here and definitely will come again next time.",

The options for families, couples or solo travellers are endless. Special shout-out to Agus for his amazing hospitality and service. His expertise in aerobics, yoga, gym, golf and tours is wonderful.   We have done the all inclusive option twice now and it is a must! Food and drinks within resorts can be expensive and the all inclusive option takes the hassle of worrying about any money related things.   We can\u2019t wait to return! ",

On another ocasion we asked for a meal in one of the restaurants and had a rushed up sloppy meal. Other than that, it was nice.

While any regular room would serve you well, we would recommend going for the awkwardly named \"LEVEL\" upgrade, which comes with the swim-in lagoon rooms and can also be purchased separately. It gives access to the private Level pool and Level beach area, with pimped-up sunbeds and unlimited suntan cream of SPF 25 and 50. The main pool has lots of noisy kids, even in the off season, as well as group activities to keep you exercised and happy. While the main restaurant serves a buffet breakfast to cater for every possible taste, Level guests can also breakfat on the beack or in the quiet and pleasant Sorrento restaurant. All in all, the on-site upgrades cost as much as the room itself, and were worth it.",

Melia provided both, the service around the poolside was fantastic, especially Febri who looked after us most days, and when we were feeling more energetic, Putu and Ian were on hand to provide yoga, water airobics and pool games. Their tour to Uluwatu was also a highlight.   Staff at all the restaurants on site were attentive without being overbearing, nothing seemed to be too much trouble.

Obviously prices of food and drinks etc are slightly more expensive than restaurants and bars outside of hotel complex. The rooms are very comfortable, and are cleaned to a very high standard, even to a maid attending in the evening to turn down the bed and leave chocolates, excellent. The staff are  amazing, Reception, Restaurant, Bar, Cleaners, and General Service staff are all so friendly and helpful, they simply cannot do enough to ensure you enjoy your stay in the Hotel and Bali. After 12 Days, our departure flight was cancelled and rearranged for 2 days later, the hotel had no hessitation in making our room available for us to let for the extra 2 nights.

The staff were all extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We had access to a separate Level pool and beach which gave the whole experience a feeling of exclusivity. On the all inclusive package we got to sample all 5 of the restaurants and most enjoyed Sakura which was Japanese. The food was at high Australian standard and the cocktails tasty and innovative. The rooms at the resort are a little dated but overall we had a fantastic experience. Very much recommended for a relaxing family beach stay in Bali.",

It in the luxury hotel district of Nusa Dua with pristine clean roads in the beautiful Balinese architecture all around.  The hotel itself has its own beach front with access to watersports, several restaurants, plenty of pools and activities for families include health and fitness.  We particularly enjoyed the  early morning Yoga near the beachfront with the sounds of the waves with our fantastic instructor Ian.  The people of Bali are generally extremely welcoming and the staff at the hotel were no exception.  As well as Bali also have to make special mention of Riya one of the front desk hosts who always seemed to be there when we needed some help. ",

I would not go for anything else, excellent value for money. Room was very spacious and quiet with swim up level pool. Bed was extremely comfortable. There are 5 main restaurants, Lotus serves excellent Asian food and has live Balinese dancers every night but no air conditioning.

From the gardeners to the room cleaners, the security staff to the reception desk - all do the Melia proud.

We spent 8 nights at Melia and that was just right to unwind, enjoy the hotel facilities and soak up the Balinese culture.  The staff here are so naturally friendly and go out of their way to make you feel special and to accommodate your every wish.  While the hotel is not as new as some others, it is very well maintained. We walked to about eight other neighbouring hotels along the Nus Dua beach front area and none of the others had the Balinese feel and look like Melia has. In our opinion, the pool areas, prolific palm trees, indoor and outdoor dining areas, entertainment and Balinese architecture make this the best hotel in Nusa Dua. We highly recommend it.",

I stayed here during the meeting in Bali and I'm pleased with everything this hotel offered. The room is nice, the breakfast is good, the hotel is huge with green ambience. The food at the sea side restaurant is well served, but the most recognisable is the service delivered by the staff, they are very helpful if you need some assistance. Special attention to Ms. Gita, the Manager who's very helpful and willing to do extra in following up my concerns, Ms. Epi and Mr. Adi at Reception who also provide best service in providing information and not to to forget the staff at breakfast who cater my needs since I'm a Vegetarian. Well done Melia, will definitely be back but for holiday not for",

Excellent kids club with lovely staff and lots of different activities to keep children busy.   The girls loved the marshmallow roast on the beach every night and the movies under the stars after. In fact they enjoyed it so much that on several nights they refused to come to dinner with us and instead stayed at kids club and we had their dinners delivered to them as it was open till 9pm.  Resort itself was lovely, only slight disappointment was that only 4 out of the 5 restaurants were open and I\u2019d have loved to have tried the Japanese.  We liked the 2 story family room. More wardrobe space is needed though as one small wardrobe is far too little storage for",

We booked through Luxury Escapes and so got the all inclusive package including the Level access with it's own pool and heaps of extras. We booked for 9 nights in a Junior suite but when we return we would be looking to book a Lagoon access room as these looked fantastic. We found the top level of our Junior suite too hot to sleep in as the air conditioning didn't cool the room down enough. This resort is definitely 5 star. The food is amazing and there are 5 restaurants to choose from. Breakfast at Sorrento was our favourite and is exclusive to the Level guests so it was always quiet in there with 5 star service. The staff throughout the hotel are a credit to the place , they",

We had the all inclusive package, which was so hard to choose from all the amazing options. Coffee was delicious down at the beach cafe.  Staff were welcoming and helpful, great kids meals available especially for fussy eaters.  My daughter loved kids club, went twice a day! She participated in lots of activities, her absolute favourite was swimming there stunning pool, the roasting marshmallows at the beach and movie night, The staff, were amazing caring and fun to all the children.  Thank you again to all the staff, we will definitely be returning hopefully next time we will choose the Lagoon access room.",

The tropical gardens and pools are amazingly designed. But for us, the best part is the Kids Club. On top of the activities that we can find in any other Kids Club, they offer indoor and outdoor activities such as swimming, marshmallow roasting, and movie night. The Miss who is taking turn to stay with my kid is also communicative and easy to talk with. As a mom, this is a big plus point. I am more confident to trust my kid with them. A big compliment for Ms Dani, Sasih, Tya, Acik, Graney and Resi. Thank you for making our stay memorable.",

Water aerobics at 10.30 by the pool is also a MUST!   If you\u2019re not as sporty, there are cultural activities for the creatives. I had fun learning Balinese dance and creating Janur.   I was incredibly lucky to get to know Ryan, one of the staff members who taught all these classes day in and out.

The only reason I stay here is I have free worry to leave my daughter in their kids club while I am swimmingat the beach, spa or join Yoga classes or do shopping in different cities, the kids can stay until 8pm. I feel like I have a private day care. It's free and many kids activities. My daughter always wants to go back to this resort for their kids club and archery activities. She remember all the staffs name who looked after her, nice experiences for her. Thank you to Miss Sasih, Miss Rinsih, Miss Dayu 1 and Miss Dayu 2,  Miss Tya who works there. Thank you for the 15mins massage from Miss Diah for my daughter. Also Adrian the Yoga instructor who is very",

It made the long flight worth with.  After settling in, we decided to try the activities that Melia Bali offered.  The instructors, Iain and Agus, were awesome.  I can't say enough good about them.  They catered to individual needs and levels while keeping each class fun and moving along.  They even came with me to the hotel gym and had a workout with me.  It was awesome.  My wife and I lounged by the beach quite a lot and were rarely without a drink.  Darma and his crew were amazing servers and we enjoyed getting to know them and their backgrounds.  The restaurants had outstanding food.  With the Level club we were able to",

Melia has been successful to form caring staff which is an extraordinary staff. Thanks to  Alep at Water Sport, Irul at gym, Agung at Archery and for sure, to Mrs Dayu who helps us everyday to arrange the activities so we tend to choose spending all the time at hotel.

We went for an all inclusive package and it was the way to go and great value for your money. Highly reccomend this resort for honeymooners or even families too. Staff were so friendly and helpful and a special mention to one bar staff member tude who went above and beyond to see that we were looked after for our stay.

Set in beautiful and expansive gardens with good-sized, clean rooms, good beds and wonderful staff, this hotel my not be young in age but can still hold its own with the sheer spendour of it all. The lagoon beach is spectacular for both the view of Mt Agung and other volcanoes, and at high tide or mid-tide, it's an absolutely stunning and safe place to swim.

The Covid 19 protocols were high which meant we could relax and enjoy the sport activities and the peaceful location. All the staff were lovely and helpful but also were not over attentive but there to help if needed. We were upgraded into a beautiful villa with a private garden and small pool which was lovely and unexpected. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful. We had a really lovely time and would definitely like to visit again.",

The front desk was excellent in caring not only for us, but all situations we observed were handled very well. The restaurant staff was great, food good (especially given COVID restrictions), and pizza on the beach was one of our favorites. Got to try paddle boarding, used the bicycles a lot - in short, had an excellent, relaxing, but not boring time.  Highly recommended!

We have stayed at a few different 5-star resorts in Bali, and this was by far our favorite, and we will always return here. From a beautiful child-friendly beach to the marshmallow roasting for kids in the evening, my children had the best time. The kids club was amazing, the bikes for kids to ride all over the resort were so much fun! At breakfast in the morning, Hendra and his team were welcoming and were very attentive to all of our needs, the breakfast options were also delicious. The manager Suarstika spoke with my family many times to make sure we were happy and comfortable and really made us feel special. We will return to the Melia again soon!",

Our two young children (5 and 7) also thoroughly enjoyed their time too.  Every morning they asked when they could go to kids club and join in with the daily activities. We would sign them in in the morning and then go to get them out for lunch but the children insisted on staying at the kids club, so they often ordered and ate lunch their. We would then collect them for dinner which they were also very reluctant to leave. My husband  and I were able to enjoy some relaxation time knowing that the children were happy and being cared for.  The highlight for them was the marshmallow toasting on the beach",

Food was top class at all restaurants, cocktails were great  but the basic spirits menu could be expanded. Gede and Aryawan looked after us on the beach whilst Warniti was excellent in the Coffee Shop. Everyone else we encountered during our stay were very helpful and friendly also. Rooms were clean and tidy , pool area large and well catered for and buffet breakfast was the best we've ever had. Chefs go out of their way to cook something special if you're a Vegan or Vego. We will be coming back especially if the Melia offers another great deal !!",

Staff are really friendly and can't do enough for you, the breakfast experience is amazing everything you could want and excellent quality.  The restaurants are also very good as is the pool are and the beach area. The option of all inclusive at 1.2 million Rupiah a day each (\u00a370) is on the expensive side there are numerous independent restaurants within 10 mins stroll of the complex or 50,000 Rupiah (\u00a33) in a cab. We couldn't get sunbeds by the beach on 2 mornings as people had put their towels on the beds, some beds weren't used until 3pm very unfair. What i also wasn't comfortable with was the Level Club, for an additional payment you get extra benefits like a private pool, fair enough. But there",

The beauty and splendour of the resort is matched by the gracious and humble staff. From the moment we walked into the lobby we knew we had arrived in paradise. This place is spectacular and yet peaceful. It caters for all age ranges and is very safe for children. The tour advisor Tini was wonderful and gave us a beautiful tour visiting a traditional Balinese village.  Bali was on my bucket list of places to visit and it did not disappoint. What makes this country special is the people and I will definitely be back.",

The kid\u2019s club was spacious and clean with a big outdoor area for the daily evening movie with popcorn. My boys esp love the daily marshmallow roasting at the beach. The kids\u2019 club activities were varied ranging from craft like bloom art to cultural activities like Balinese traditional rt and crafts, making fish and birds out of coconut leaves. We also loved that the kids got to dress up in traditional Balinese clothes to visit the hotel temple as well as to join the special Galungan procession. But above all, we love the very attentive and caring kids\u2019 club staff, who communicated with me promptly",

So we moved to the Melia on another all inclusive package in the family room. We were here last September and had a great time and this visit has been just as great!  Included in our package was the Level Upgrade which has been nice for some extra perks, but with kids under 12 years old you can\u2019t use all the extra perks such as the beautiful Level Pool. However we just used it when the kids went to the kids club.   The kids club is large and our kids loved all the extra activities. At night",

Teachers ( Dani, tya,aci, Sasih, Resi, the train man, the archery mister) not only take care but they know how to react with kid. I mean not just nice but they teach something and thats why I dont think it is not only just put your kid to play but it is like a holiday camp. Outdoor activities, indoor, movie night with popcorn, origami, play with card, marshmallows and etc.  For food (breakfast and restaurant) i will said is ok coz is pandemic so understandble. Lack",

The 5 restaurants are a bit pricey for the quality. The gym was perfect with gym trainers on top of their game (thanks Ian for the many boxe sparring sessions). All in all, a great place to stay :)",

A dream, beautiful, comfortable and quiet. Also perfect the Level Lounge (esp. Doni and Yudi) and the Sorrento Restaurant for breakfast. Wi-Fi was working excellent this year, even at the Level pool and the beach. One day at the Level Lounge during Cocktail time, we spoke about what to do on our 35th Anniversary day. On this day, after spending some hours on the beach, we found a decorated villa with white swans, blossoms, chocklate cake and a nice letter from the manager. But this wasn\u2018t all, they prepared for us a romantic dinner at the beach. A special thank you for your effort, it was unforgettable. We hope to be back next years.",

It's created an exceptionally warm, relaxing and interactive environment for people of all ages.  Over the years, The Level Manager Miss Yuli has always made sure that we are well taken care of, makes time to reconnect, and actively finds new ways to make improvements around the hotel.  Agus is one of the many, excellent fitness instructors who is always eager to share new learnings, as well as introduce a variety of class formats - each with a wide range of health benefits for everyone to enjoy.  Whether you're looking to relax or immerse yourself in new activities, Melia has it all! I recommend them to everyone I know, without hesitation.",

For instance, a dedicated pool for Level families turns out to be a \"backyard\" of Lagoon rooms - Lagoon rooms have pools in the back of the room, and we ended up sharing these pools with the Lagoon guests.  We had paid extra $ for Level privilege for the family including kids; however, we didnt receive the extra services because kids are not allowed in many areas.  So, why were we asked / encouraged to pay more?!",

Then the hotel, very well located on a nice beach, with all the confort and the amenities you can expect from a 5 star hotel in 2022. The food, very well cooked and of good quality , with a nice variety of setup depending on the restaurant. But if you come with kids, it is WONDERLAND.., movie nights, BBQ marshmallows, tons of cool activities all day long, and more than anything a staff that LOVES kids and you can feel it. It is a pleasure for your kid to go to the kidsclub, so for the parents :) Our 4 year old son Zack keeps talking about those holidays... we will be back next year, for sure ! ",

        "comment": "A last minute decision checking into Melia Bali turned out an unforgettable family trip. Although the check-in experience was marred by a small mistake of not able to provide 2 connecting rooms for our family, we experienced one of the most pleasant front office services. The front office manager Ms.Gita and her staff at the reception were most attentive to our problem with a smile at all time. Not only things start to get better from there, we met so many friendly and attentive staff in Melia Bali including Cinta in Lotus restaurant and staffs at Sateria. Highly recommending the all inclusive package in this truly authentic Balinese style hotel.",

Maria from the kids club was a great babysitter for my son. Breakfast buffet was yum. My only suggestion is for more shade over the pool.",

At Sateria Basma and Chandra have made us feel like celebrities. Always attentive, very quick to deliver our orders and communicate to us the various activities that can be enjoyed around the resort but also happy to explain to us more about the local Balinese life. We learned so much from them, and we have never seen such quality staff members anywhere else.   At the level pool Artha was so responsive and happy to help too! The staff truly lifts this place to another level of high quality customer service.

We spent most of our time in this lagoon.    Overall,  this property is excellent- clean rooms,  courteous staff, great food and access to beach.    Staff is extremely prompt. During our visit to their coffee shop , Kopitian, I asked,  if they have vegan cakes.  They didn't have but had plant- based milk for coffee.  I suggested that they should have vegan options for desserts too. Next day,  their food manager came with the chef and offered to make vegan breakfast for me.  The chef prepared chia porridge which was delicious.   This was our 4th visit to Bali and by far,  the best one.",

We enjoyed beautiful meals in lovely venues every night of our stay with amazing steaks at the beach side restaurant and the Japanese was sensational.  The pool was lovely and the kids (6&8) swam all day and we took part in the daily aqua aerobics and basketball games. The gym and outdoor classes were a welcome addition to our trip and provided some respite from the constant opportunity to eat and drink.  Special mention to the lovely Dewa Ayu from Kopi Petani. The service she provided was impeccable and she quickly learnt my coffee order even",

However I would like, to give some advise , for people on a budget, take the all-inclusive formula, or buy your drinks at the warung Naya, exemple 2 small beers will cost you, 188.000 idr out of your minibar, where at Naya's, which is just at the right side on the beach, you will pay",

The breakfast very delicious in offshore restaurant so that we can see the beach and enjoy the sunrise.  The room is clean. We can hear the birds singing outside when wake up in the morning.",

A special mention must go to Yudi in the Level Lounge - the brightest of smiles every day, professional always, and extremely helpful. He knew our party by name, remembered our preferences and even helped with medical assistance when one of our party was unwell. Nothing was too much trouble for him, which is exactly what you\u2019d hope for from a concierge service. Melia Bali are lucky to have him - one to watch! ",

As you can imagine our expectations were much higher than those who were on a cheap holiday.  That being said, our room was better but all other experiences were the same for us and discount guests.  The overall buildings are ok, but are getting older and in my opinion for a 5 star hotel are in need of renovation.  The Sorrento and Sakura restaurants were the highlights. Poolside service can be very slow. Staff are friendly and apologetic but there could be a more efficient way to manage the bar and poolside food - once food arrives it can then take additional time for the bill to come back for your signature, this can be frustrating especially when you are already wearing",

The thing that stood out immediately was how the staff were there to ensure all your needs and comfort were met, always with a smile. Breakfast in Sorrento\u2019s had fabulous selection of food that catered for everyone and had the option of Al fresco or air conditioned seating. I can\u2019t praise this enough, we had Christmas swimming in the Indian Ocean on our private beach and in the pool, all set within the beautiful landscape gardens and palm trees.

The restaurants, bars, pool area and activities were first class.  Nusa duo is a lovely area to holiday in for relaxation and Melia is positioned well.   I can\u2019t comment enough on the attention from all the gracious Melia Bali staff, they have made our holiday very special.

All of the staff were lovely and our two girls aged 6 and 2 had the best time. In fact my 6 year old didn't want to leave!! Thank you so much to Dani from the kids club who was so accommodating and helpful to our two girls, they still mention Dani's name from time to time and cannot wait to go back! Great Christmas Eve dinner with a magician walking around and the kids singing carols. We have fantastic memories of our family holiday and will go back to Melia in the future!",

As a result everything felt damp and in the morning the floor was so humid it was slippery. The staff was very kind but, at least in the international restaurant at the beach, not really up to the task. They wanted to serve the starter after the main course.",

The design of the villa is luxurious (both the interior and the exterior. Easy to find spots for taking photos and selfies. Also love the main garden and the beachfront.

You could understand what I'm saying just with the very first sight.  And secondary, as I've already said, the staffs are so amazing.

But we got to join the bicycle tour which was fantastic!  Shoutout to all the lovely staff who made the stay even more enjoyable.

My favourite dish there is the mozzarella cheese and ham omelette. Also, I could do many activities such as riding a bicycle, playing archery, canoeing, etc. In there, I met Kak Ian while playing archery. He was really nice to me and my sister. He taught us how to play archery in the proper way. Thank you, kak Ian! Another thing I love is their private beach, it\u2019s very beautiful and clean.

        "comment": "Staying at Melia during crazy covid crisis is one of the best thing you can do if you stay in Bali. Going with your kids is even better ! The Kids Club gives the adults the opportunity of a real free time to rest on the \"Cabana\"on the beach. Staff is so helpful ! Rooms and Villas are just affordable right now, take your chance to say in a 5 stars hotel for the price of a 3 *. Enjoy the long resting day (check out is at 6 pm) on the beach without a mask !  Eat at the beach restaurant, or in the \"cabanas\"right on the beach. The place to be to stay happy and relax.",

When I requested late check out, the hotel told me that my family room will be occupied soon but surprisingly they offered me to move to other room for my late check out. Knowing that the hotel lack of staffs due to the high seasons and crowd, I decided not to take the room and just staying at departure lounge. My kids still can enjoy all of the activities though we have checked out and can take a shower at departure lounge.  The only thing needs to be improved is the quality of the breakfast.  Need a lot of improvement as a five stars hotel.",

The restaurants served wonderful food, we especially enjoyed the Lotus, and the beach restaurant eating overlooking the sea, the food was amazing. The hotel was spotless and had such a calm ambiance to it, I would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to friends and family.",

The staff are extremely friendly, kind and helpful and there is plenty to do if you don't want to leave the resort. The food menus at the restaurants and the pool were pretty reduced compared to when I first stayed pre-covid, but there was still a big enough variety and all the food we had was great. Given the difficulties that the community and tourism industry in Bali faced over Covid, I thought the resort was doing an amazing job at getting back up and running. All the staff were doing their best to ensure all guests had a great time, and I definitely did. Well done to the team at Melia and I look forward to returning as",

Ensuring we had plenty of water, asking after our wellbeing and even making a special brew of chicken soup for us when food was not on our radar.  It broke my heart not being able to enjoy the awesome Christmas buffet lunch which was off the charts and as good as I have seen anywhere in my travels across the planet.

There was a nice tropical garden and a dining area for room service. The bed was huge and beautiful, indoor and outdoor showers and a huge bath tub. Due to the pandemic only one restaurant was open and that was the beach club which had nice views and vibe.

All Inclusive was nice the menu in all the restaurant's were very limited, usually you have plenty to choose from in all the restaurants. Although there wasn't a great choice the food we had was lovely, maybe the cut backs were because the resort was very quiet, hope the food choice goes back to normal.

We had upgraded to the Level and was it worth it, from the minute we arrived until we departed we were pampered and looked after from all the staff, but special mention for Sunnarini, Yudi and Darma, you were all amazing and made our holiday that bit more special. The Hotel Melia was everything we had hoped for, the food, gardens, pool and beaches were immaculately looked after, and the staff were so warm and friendly, would definitely recommend this hotel for a super relaxing holiday.  Thanks to everyone, keep up the good work.",

During the month spent at the M\u00e9lia hotel, I was able to appreciate all the beauty of its gardens and the lagoon, all the comfort of the rooms with direct access to the swimming pool, all the hospitality and kindness of the people who are  invest in it and in particular Ian, with whom I had the pleasure of practicing yoga and pilates almost daily.  A wonderful cocktail to fill up with beautiful energies.  Don't wait any longer!",

Cons  Room Interior was bit old. Curtains bit torn Room service was bad After 2 nights, we upgraded to Level guests room, and service for level guest was pathethic. We forgot to take the mobile chargers along and we informed staff immediately after checkout, but we didnt get those back ever.  Overall it was a comfortable stay except the inconvenience caused by LEVEL guest service. ",

We stayed at the Meli\u00e1 Bali Nusa Dua on the recommendation of friends. Another great decision!  The resort's structure is impeccable. However, what caught our attention even more was the high quality of the services, despite the many challenges imposed by the pandemic.   The maintenance of the facilities was excellent, the quality of the services was amazing, the drinks and foods were always fresh, and the employees' attention and care were admirable.  I also want to register a compliment to Mr. Edouard and to Mr. Hendra on behalf of all the employees who have served us so well. Terrific job!

The rooms and its amenities are excellent. There is an option for everyone: luxury, family, etc. My family and I did enjoy very much all the services and the accommodation.

Our kids often ask about when we go to see Dani, Maria, Sasih and Finda again at Melia, as they just love it there.

I recognize the hotel was extra busy due to NYE, but unfortunately my stay was plagued with recurring problems that just led to an overall disappointing stay. I paid a lot for my room, and I just expected better.  1. Our 2 rooms weren't ready until past 4pm. We arrived with a cranky child and couln't check in (boooo) 2. We wanted to leave the hotel and another car was double parked in front of our spot. It took the hotel 45+ minutes to resolve this. Where is security? 3.

We decided to explore and take a peek \u2026.\ud83d\ude04  Even though, we have our own private villa for our accommodation. We are interesting in the program that offered to us especially for our kids that need their own \u201cme time\u201d during this moment.   Finally\u2026 We decided to make a reservation for 2 nights stay, and expecting great experience for our beloved sons.  The Hotel high standards of health protocols for Cov-19 is one of the highlight, it gave us a secured feeling and comforts.  Thank you for great service and warm hospitality showed by Mrs. Dayu from the Melia Bali Entertainment Department, which made us to have this blessed decision to enjoy our stay and  the program offered.

After long time of pandemic, we finally could leave work and school behind and fly to Bali to our favorite hotel Melia Bali Nusa Dua. The main beauty of the resort are the staff. The staff at the lounge Ari, Yudi, Ayu, Doni, Gung Gek  are amazing. Ever so friendly and always met us with warm smile. My husband had a medical situation in Bali, and since the staff learnt about it they were all very attentive and helpful. Exceptional service from lounge staff made our stay comfortable and happy at Melia Bali Nusa Dua. We can\u2019t wait to come back and stay at the level again. I can say staff of the resort is the main beauty. You feel the care and passion in all they do. Thank you for taking care of my family. ",

The water activities was fun too! Trying paddle board for the first time and it was exciting!  I do love their kids activities especially when you stay in Friday, Saturday they got Carnival which your kids i guarantee will be having so much fun! Marshmallow bonfire and movie night too! While kiddos do their activities we can enjoy the sunset or relaxing in the cabana facing the beach or just chills at the bar. This is what i called family hotel!",

Agus and Alep were both fantastic providing great instruction and fun and were very generous with their time. The gym is very well set up and the departure lounge makes the planning for a late flight much easier The only negative was that we did not have the all inclusive package and other restaurants were a little out of the way.",

From Junior Suite upgraded to Junior Suite Lagoon Access was indeed very generous. Melia Bali is an old property but still one of choices in ITDC that is 5* worth. The room is very modern though, the bed in Junior suite is one of the best bed I have ever slept on. Breakfast at Sorento was great, all breakfast items has good quality, except the black coffee and latte tasted very mild (love strong ones).",

I got what I have paid for,  small old room, small bed and old low ceiling bathroom with small bathtub. However, the room is well sanitized and very clean.   My important note is for shower handle, it does not fit with the bracket,  so that heavy shower handle can easly fell off from the bracket, I was hit  my shoulder, it was so dangerous, luckyly it did not hit my head which can possibly happened because the shower chamber  is so narrow and low.

I could literally walk the grounds all day it's so enchanting with its pure traditional balinese enbience. Staff are wonderful and fall over themselves to look after you. Our Anniversary meal was beyond our expectations having Wahgu (not sure of the correct spelling sorry) wait on us he was fantastic.

It was the best surprise ever! The hotel has kept its high standards of operation even with very few guests. The hotel is clean, alive, colorful! Live music every night, great food menu, with many options for vegetarians. We have 2 little ones and they have an amazing kids club and marshmallow bonfire every afternoon, with movie session for the children on the weeked. I was amazed by their reception, friendly behaviour. They have all the best practices on social distance, cleaning, masks and face shield. Alcohol gel everywhere. I felt safe and welcomed.

I had an opportunity to look at the pool villa and have rebooked again to go in the next 12 months as I enjoyed it so much. The staff were amazing all very helpful. Just a really relaxing environment. Staying in the level also enhanced our stay as we had a large private adult pool. Thank you can\u2019t wait to go back. Definitely recommend ",

Don't worry about the parents as they have bar, coffee stall, shisha spot, sparkle bar, cabanas, dj, and live music. So the adults are well entertained too.

The Level team took care of every detail in our stay, the room was beautiful and comfy, the food was that good that we did all our meals there, breakfast even with Covid restrictions had a lot of variety and the Christmas dinner was just espectacular. Definitely we will be back to this hotel in our next visit to Bali!",

We really enjoyed all the activities that the hotel provide for the guests, especially the kids and teenager activities both indoor and outdoor. The staffs were very kind, caring and helpful toward all my children. They took care of the children very well during all the activities. Thank you to Miss Acik, Miss Dani, Miss Sasih, Miss Tya, Miss Resi, Miss Dayu, Mr Alep and Mr. Edmund. The hotel also had delicious breakfast with great food varieties. We hope that we can come back here soon. Thank you Melia Bali for this great holiday.  Love from us, Claudia - Emmeline",

We were delighted that the hotel and grounds were immaculately maintained.  The staff, many of them new, were great.  The Meli\u00e1 management has done a fantastic job in keeping the long time staff part-time doing maintenance etc. during COVID.",

The hotel is magnificent with its shimmering vegetation of colors and greens so vibrant, its ponds, its statues, its beach, its swimming pools ... All this in addition to the welcome and the bright smiles of a benevolent team.  What joy and what beautiful energies to practice morning yoga facing the Ocean at Nusa Gede, Waterblow or in the Spa garden with Ian, the yoga teacher.  When we come there, we just want to stay or come back.  The best is to try!",

It was the perfect way to end an exhausting adventurous trip to finally be able to truly relax. The resort has everything you need and there is a very nice shopping mall with stores and restaurants within walking distance as well. We ended up staying a few nights longer because we just weren't ready to leave! I don't know if the upgrade to the level at all Melias is necessary, but it definitely makes a difference here. The service with the level and access to the private lagoon right outside your door is fantastic. You are lucky if you have the privilege of meeting and working with Yudi!

Although it is a large hotel we had a wonderful stay. We had a level lagoon access room which was fantastic, especially for our two young children. The staff through the entire hotel were incredible, so friendly and professional. We would  like to especially thank the staff in the kids club. They were all amazing, Our two girls had a ball in the kids club everyday. We had never visited a kids club before, it was fantastic! A big shout out especially to Presi and Finda, who were incredible with our girls (age 4 and 6 years). So friendly, so fun and professional, we simply adored them! We have already booked to come back next year.",

Seems like a great place for older kids too, the gals working in the kids\u2019 club are so sweet. The menu is not huge or the cheapest you can find in Bali. But if convenience is more of a concern (I.e., traveling with toddler and baby) you can\u2019t ask for anything better. This was our second time and we would definitely come back.",

What makes place amazing is the exceptional staff, every single person is to be commended on the service provided to the guests. I have been to many luxury resorts but this one is one of my favorite place now! We got the deal all inclusive which was the best decision we made. The selection of the restaurants is amazing and the standard food is of high standard. The activities during the day are so good! Especially the aquatic exercises in the pool everyday in the morning. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. I truly recommend this place and can not wait to come back again.",

Also on the other room for our friend\u2019s celebration of their first pregnancy \ud83d\udc95 we all are amazed with the beautiful landscape of Melia Bali. Perfect combination of nature and Balinese architecture.  Pool has warm water, so it\u2019s very shooting and relaxing.  Beautiful beach too! Breakfast was fantastic\u2026  Special thanks to Ms. Gita - Guest Experience Manager for making sure that our stay is unforgettable.",

I agree the rooms are a little dated, but how long do you spend in the room anyway, and worth paying the extra for the suite for more space and definitely worth going all inclusive as the food here is fantastic, beautifully cooked and presented.  The staff are very helpful, cant do enough for you and the service is great.  Maybe the people who are waiting upto 40 minutes for drinks should go to the bar themselves\ud83e\udd14 as the staff never stop! An amazing time in an amazing place",

If you are looking for a foodie escape then I might go with a hotel situated more centrally in Bali However a perfect oasis if you want to just get away and chill.  Four stars due to the fact that the prices of the resort food were a bit on the high side together with the fact that the hotel taxi kept being recommended. If you want to get to Denpasar, Seminyak, Kira, Sanur go with a bluebird.  ",

Mustafa made the evening for us balancing attentiveness with care and leave aloneness. The meal was memorable but not as much as breakfast the next day. We werent going fancy so it was buffet breakfast with 1 million people. My body language must have said it all as Mustafa extracted me from the chaos and took me to Aladdin's cave. Private breakfast room, space, quiet and lobster, more lobster and just a bit more to recover from NYE. True testimony to someone passionate and experienced with people and making them a priority. thank you Mustafa and Melia.",

The Melia did not disappoint....the family suites are perfect for families of 5 like ours and some of the meals we\u2019ve had in this hotel are amongst the best in Bali! By far the highlight of this trip both times has been the Kids Club, hence our return. The staff is outstanding and nothing is ever a problem! Their love for children and their job is genuine and I would return again just to see the staff that we have all formed friendships with.

The new family level beach area does disturb the hitherto peace and tranquility of the Adults only level beach. The introduction of pedal go karts is a disaster waiting to happen, the paths around the resort are narrow there isn't room for pedestrians and some out of control go karts, someone is going to get really hurt.  I would like to praise the fantastic staff who looked after us for a month.

We loved all the activities that they have included, we had so much fun with archery but our favorite was definitely squash and kayaking. The staff at the restaurant were super friendly. Pak Naya was our waiter and he was always giving his best and making sure we were having a great time. We were surprised to hear some of the staff speak perfect Spanish. Pak Sumertha at the restaurant knew so much about Mexico and our culture; chatting with him was a bliss.  We stayed at a garden villa and my sister at a lagoon pool. Both rooms were truly amazing and perfect for our needs.  Without a doubt, when we come back to Bali for a family trip we will definitely come back to Meli\u00e1.",

Only downside if any is there is no shopping nearby if that's what your interested in. But as a relaxing holiday it's perfect. Clean rooms, great air-conditioning and the Level pool is private and quiet. The beach is good to swim in when the tides in as well.Special mentions to Karin in Sorrento Resteraunt..... Artawiguna,Juli , Oka and Darma in the Level",

Staff are so welcoming and helpful, food was delicious with great kids meals available.   Myself and 2 daughters had a lagoon access room which was great for the girls!   My youngest attended kids club, at her own choice a majority of the days there! I couldn't keep her away, which is so unlike her! The staff, Graney, Dani, Dewi, Resi, Tya, Aci, Sasih and Maria were just beautiful, so caring and fun!  Thank you for making Mariahs visits to kids club so enjoyable!",

From the beginning I didn't want to go to Bali, I was very skeptical, once I arrived at Melia Bali Resort straightway I got in love with the place.  When we got off from the taxi we've been greeted by beautiful and amazing staff. At the reception, we have been served in such a very helpful and professional manner with a welcome drink and a big smile. Everything looked like I live in Paradise. I loved every single moment of my stay there. OMG and the kids club was the best thing to make our holiday PERFECT. My daughter loved all the staff who works there. Dani (my daughter's favorite), Sasih, Dayu, Finda, Graney, and Resi made my daughter feel loved and looked after. There were",

The  amazing staff is truly the strenght of this resort as they try their very best to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  Special mention to Ms Sunarini, front of house who assisted and also Mr Dharma at the Level beach and Mr Aria at the fire pit lounge.  The ladies at the spa were just incredible.   Thank you for making our holiday a very special one.      The resort is great for families with kids activies and cute outdoor cinema setting but also really good for couples.   The beach restaurant is great and beautifully lit at night.  Live music every night completes the atmosphere.     We loved the food at the beach restaurant, specially the pizzas and pasta.    ",

Thank you to all the wonderful staff for literally spoiling us, especially Witana at the front desk who couldn\u2019t do enough to accommodate us. He\u2019s a great salesman too, we ended up in one of the beautiful Villas! The attention to detail was incredible, we had our own private pool, garden, outside dining area, relaxing bungalow etc and that was just in the garden. Inside the villa was luxurious and I cannot wait to return, this time with my husband, as it\u2019s very all very romantic!! Thank you again for the perfect 2 day stay",

The service was excellent, friendly and helpfull staff. My kids love the marshmallow time and the kids club. The breakfast was great. Nice pool with warm water. Cons, the jet spray in the toilet too short. Will definitely come back to Melia Bali!",

Lovely caring caregivers and lots for the children to do. Plenty of space to kick and play with their balls and the pool was great as well. The staff were friendly and gave great service and the property is beautiful with its plantings, water features etc.  The breakfast had lots of choice and plenty of room for large tables. We would definitely return.",

But my favorites were the sports activities.  Pak Diarsa was the person who guided us with all the sports: from canoe to badminton, tennis and squash. Also Dayu who was very helpful in arranging the activities. Big appreciation to all the housekeeping staff who used complete APD. Also my mom enjoyed interacting with the Restaurant staff.

Kids club okay but think it needs more options for bugger kids (my son was 9 and needed more - my 5 year okd was quite happy).  Staff in there also great.    Did the all inclusive Level family and was worth the money.  Everything that we ate and drank was included.  Options were great amongst the five restaurants onsite.  The Level made it feel a little nore special.  Located in a compound of resorts, it\u2019s the last one on the right as you face out to the water.  The beach is on a reef so pretty safe for kids and no real waves.  Nice little market next door that does amazing massages, cheap laundry, food and the hair braiding.  It was just fantastic.  Also check out Water Bom water park - so much",

To the gorgeous ladies who took such care of our daughter in the kids club and all the staff at the Level pool; you guys are the real MVP\u2019s.   See you next year! From Miss Amelia, Mr Rick (always Prost), and Ms Ally (double-double).",

The room was clean and large and the bed extra comfy. Food and drinks at all the restaurants and bars was fantastic. But the best part of all was the service at Melia, which was simply outstanding. In particular, I want to thank Yudi and Dewa Ayu (The Level), and Darma and Sari for taking such wonderful care of us during our stay. You will be missed! But we will be back, with the rest of the family next time! ",

The Melia Nusa Dua Resort and the people in Bali have changed her mind forever. After 10 nights she and my 6 year old daughter didn't want to leave. What a relaxing venue. Excellent Kids Club and the staff were amazing, I hardly saw my daughter all holiday as there was always something exciting going on at the kids club day and night. A big thank you to Dani and the Kids Club team so professional and friendly,  you are amazing.  We will be back to see you next year.  Please do not change a thing.",

It turns out that this hotel is still outstanding in terms of service, facilities and atmosphere. I originally booked at Lagoon Access but later upgraded to a villa. Truly a very enjoyable and unforgettable vacation. Thank you to the management and staff who continue to provide special services even in difficult times. Hopefully after the pandemic period passes, this hotel can achieve glory.  And one thing, I can bet I'll be back here as soon as possible",

Plus activities each day if you want to get involved. The place is beautiful and we also loved our room. Couldn't of wanted more for an all inclusive and our room service. Great time. Only point I would make is over Xmas there were lots of children. So not always great when the pool is full of boisterous children. Well it's good for those who have them I guess! But for a romantic couple break there maybe better options. We still loved our time here and would love to go back. Thank you ",

We tried archery, there was bike hire, massage, spa etc. Great place for a romantic retreat. Safe swimming in the sea, but quite shallow a long way out.

We had two different rooms in separate visits, the second room with a big wrap around balcony. They are well appointed and nicely air conditioned. Great service at the bar, the beach and the beach side restraurant. The breakfasts are amazing with many different cultural dishes at your disposal. It is a large resort so can be a long walk to your room but not a issue with us. A easy walk to the Bali Collection along the beach for evening dining and shopping at its best.

The staff are so friendly, the service was outstanding; the food, drinks and attention to detail. We went to all 5 restaurants and especially loved the Tepinaki at the Japanese restaurant. The other restaurants were also fantastic. Special thanks to ADI, Sari, Resti, Darma, Aretha, and Iuova as well as Egi and Darma from Lotis restaurant, and Doni and the lovely young lady who greeted us on arrival. Would definitely recommend this place booked through Luxury Escapes and would love to come back. Thank you so much \ud83d\ude4f Leanne & Ben Ward",

They had a great park for kids and tables and chairs for kids to draw. The food here was great and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I went home home happy.",

The Kids club was one of the best I\u2019ve seen as run by the wonderful ladies Dani, Sasih, Finda, Dayu, Graney and Resi. All the staff were excellent with the children.  I would definitely stay here again. ",
