I had a long layover at Bali so I decided to book a day room at the hotel , it all worked 100 % . Airport pickup was good as was the check - in porocess . The room was clean . For the very low price I paid this was an excellent option , as I could relax and shower before going back to the airport for my long flight home .#### #### ####[([38], [40], 'POS'), ([46], [45], 'POS')]
This hotel is very near to Kuta beach and other attractions near Kuta . Most of the attraction is in walking distance but thats it . The rooms are just ok with no frills , and the hot water in my room was not working properly and I think they don ' t change the linens daily The breakfast menu is not very creative . We had the same menu every morning .#### #### ####[([1], [4, 5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([27], [30], 'NEU'), ([37, 38], [43, 44], 'NEG'), ([55], [50, 51, 52, 53], 'NEG'), ([58], [61, 62, 63], 'NEG')]

I put it as title because this fact is iritating for me & my friend . Other than that , this hotel is clean enough . Good service and good breakfast . The best of it is good location .

Cheap hotel , good location , by the beach . But the room is not clean enough when we check in , the toilet is not working well , and they have dirty linen .

Clean , friendly staff , very good overall . Close to all shops and the beach .

This was for an overnight stay in Bali , as reported it is near to the airport so good access to the airport , the hotel reception area gives you a false sense of security a facade behind that is a noisy hotel with small rooms that need some TLC , the bar is poorly stocked and consists of a couple of Chairs and tables at the back of the reception .#### #### ####[([42], [41], 'NEG'), ([45], [44], 'NEG'), ([52], [54, 55], 'NEG')]

The Impala 60s restaurant at Fave Hotel is less than favourable . The service was extremely slow and the food mediocre at best .

Booked this hotel for our last night in Bali . My room smelled like moth balls and dank basement - nice ! The room was extremely run down and as others have noticed , this hotel is extremely loud . Avoid at all costs . There are so many more cheap hotels that are lovely in the area , don ’ t book as a last resort !#### #### ####[([2], [0], 'NEU'), ([11], [12], 'NEG'), ([23], [26, 27], 'NEG'), ([35], [38], 'NEG')]
I stayed at the hotel on 20th of August 2016 , on my anniversary . The hotel helped me so much on preparing the surprise in the room . The Front Desk staff was also very professional and very welcomed . Much smiles . Love it .#### #### ####[([32], [36], 'POS'), ([32], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([32], [42], 'POS')]
One of the best hotels in Kuta , spacious rooms but no windows , bathroom is ok , the best part of this hotel is the rooftop bar & swimming pool . Very good place to relax and have a sunbathing , pool is very clean and overlooking the ocean . Breakfast is ok just need to improve with varieties .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6], [0, 1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([9], [8], 'POS'), ([14], [16], 'NEG'), ([9], [11, 12], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([29, 30], [18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([42], [45], 'POS'), ([42], [47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([51], [53], 'NEU'), ([51], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'NEG')]
I booked for airport pick up 31st January at 23 : 25 . But the driver arrived very late , got to the hotel after 1 am in the morning ! Breakfast had a small selection and small amount not enough to cater for the guests . Waiting too long for the kitchen staff cooking to fill the buffet server .#### #### ####[([15], [18], 'NEG'), ([47], [49], 'NEG'), ([31], [34, 35], 'NEG')]
We stayed in a poolview room , ground floor . Great room , aircon was cold , but lighting was a little dark . Bathroom was clean and the water pressure was good . Helpful staff and great location .

the best hotel in bali below $ 50 / night and for $ 30 / night it is a real steal , I have been to bali many times and been to about 15 - 20 hotels and none are the level of this place and for the price it ' s really amazing !#### #### ####[([48], [53], 'POS'), ([44], [53], 'POS'), ([2], [1], 'POS'), ([2], [19, 20], 'POS')]

After having problems with the first hotel I went to Aqua Ozz and they were really good and found us a room so we could get out of the other hotel . The room was fine and cleaned everyday the service was good the only problem was the pool isn ' t deep enough but that didn ' t worry us . I enjoyed my stay and would stay there again .#### #### ####[([33], [35], 'POS'), ([33], [37], 'POS'), ([40], [42], 'POS'), ([48], [49, 50, 51, 52], 'NEG')]
As An Accor Le Club Gold Member I can say this Ibis stands out . Well done ! Staff were very helpful and friendly . Rooftop pool is very convenient , wish it could stay open longer .

We only stayed for one day , but for what we saw there are no complaints . It is is a great location , nice small pool and the staff are friendly . You are in walking distance to beach , shops , cafes , restaurants ETC . If you are on a budget , this is a great hotel with pricing about $ 25 AUD per night . Do recommend .#### #### ####[([22], [21], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [24], 'POS'), ([29], [31], 'POS'), ([59], [58], 'POS')]
It ' s a nice and clean budget hotel , with comfortable bed and nice shower . Too bad they didn ' t serve breakfast ( I stayed at the much cheaper budget hotel that still provides breakfast ) . However , I appreciate their cleanliness , air - conditioned rooms , hot shower and room service . Things cannot be guaranteed in other budget hotels .#### #### ####[([8], [4], 'POS'), ([8], [6], 'POS'), ([8], [7], 'POS'), ([12], [11], 'POS'), ([15], [14], 'POS'), ([24], [20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG'), ([45], [43], 'POS')]

We moved to this Hotel because its closer to the Double Six Beach . But it was truly a wrong decision . The room smelled very musty , it was unclean and dirty . My duvet cover had some brown undefined stains , it looked like fecal . The towels weren ' t white , they turn into gray . It was just disgusting ! !#### #### ####[([4], [1], 'NEU'), ([12], [7], 'POS'), ([23], [24], 'NEG'), ([23], [30], 'NEG'), ([23], [32], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [41], 'NEG'), ([49], [63], 'NEG')]

Small clean and comfy room . . Bathroom is too small for a big size person and when you ' re late for bath , you might not get warm water . .

Modern hotel with a very clean room . The pool is to small to swim . The breakfast is balinese ( rice , nasi ) but there is also toast , an egg station and cornflakes . The beach is like 10 min walking .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([6], [5], 'POS'), ([9], [12], 'NEG'), ([38], [40, 41, 42, 43], 'POS')]
Friendly staff with lovely clean rooms , although they were quite dark inside . Nice clean pool to lounge around , breakfast was average but it ' s easy to go elsewhere . Very close to airport , and they can arrange transport for free - so perfect for an overnight stay .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([5], [3], 'POS'), ([5], [4], 'POS'), ([5], [11], 'NEG'), ([16], [14], 'POS'), ([16], [15], 'POS'), ([21], [23], 'NEU')]
Old hotel needs refurbishing rooms are huge as well as bathrooms but it is a lot of wasted space . Pool had algae in it and I think they need to put a kettle in the rooms .

Overall , simple and nice - a better rotation to clean the rooms would have been nice . Pool was small and customer service could be improved .
