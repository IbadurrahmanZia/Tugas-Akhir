A nice little quiet hotel . Great rooms with working aircon , working enough that I got cold at night . A fair walk to the main drag though , but if you walk the beach then its a nice walk . First timers , dont let beach sellers into the hotel , if you are going to buy , got out to them . And be sure to visit the dolphins .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([4], [1], 'POS'), ([7], [6], 'POS'), ([10], [9], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [22, 23], 'POS'), ([35], [39, 40], 'POS')]

This ibis is ok if you are coming from Jakarta or Papua for a couple of days to relax and have parties , bars and beach nearby .

We enjoyed a villa during our honeymoon in Melia Bali . It has been an awesome experience . The villa had a private pool , large garden area , different chill - out lounges and a very spacious bedroom . The service is awesome and the staff is more than friendly and professional .#### #### ####[([3], [1], 'POS'), ([22, 23], [20, 21], 'NEU'), ([26, 27], [25], 'POS'), ([38], [37], 'POS'), ([41], [43], 'POS'), ([46], [50, 51, 52], 'POS')]
This is a very good hotel , clean and big room and friendly staff , the only thing is the location , which is a little far from the beach but we walked the day that we stayed there . The breakfast was buffet but is more Asian food than western .

This is a new hotel , pleasant staff , and average breakfast buffet . The location to the airport is convenient , but to Bali sites is a problem . Road construction makes traffic difficult during the day . For the price , and if you are willing to fight the traffic , it ' s a reasonable choice for the budget conscious traveler .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([7], [6], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [10], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS'), ([24, 25], [28], 'NEG')]

If you are looking for a strategic budget hotel this is the place . I brought a whole family and they enjoy the stay . Only 200 meters from the beach .

Customer service is the worse ever in Bali , so many mosquito , air con leak everywhere , when we book they said we get free Internet but we have to buy drink to get the password , breakfast suck , we ask for queen bed but they put two single bed together .

My time at this hotel was very disappointing , management was rude ( barking orders to staff & finger pointing ) and arrogant / indifferent to guests .

We booked this hotel as it is only 5 mins from the airport but very quiet . The rooms are comfortable , the breakfast enjoyable and varied , and the pool was clean , cool and had shaded areas .

A practical , nice budget hotel . No outside window in our room , but we did not really miss that anyway , being in the middle of busy Kuta streets . It ' s within a walking distance from many restaurants , shops etc . Also the Perama bus office is close enough to walk to , if you want to use their bus services in Bali .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([12], [7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
This is a greet place for a relaxed stop . You can walk from the airport ! It ' s only about 300 metres . Nice rooms , swimming pool , lovely breakfast and really good staff .

buffet break fast is average . cold chunks of butter floating in water container is not an appetizing sight . cooked for vegetarians is limited to mixed vegetable .

I only stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of my holiday , and was only in Legian to shop so this hotel was perfectly located for that purpose . My room was clean and functional , with good A / C . I didn ' t have breakfast included but I did order room service and I felt the servings were quite small .#### #### ####[([22], [24, 25], 'POS'), ([31], [33], 'POS'), ([31], [35], 'POS'), ([31], [38, 39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([48], [43, 44, 45, 46, 47], 'NEG'), ([60], [61, 62, 63], 'NEG')]
bali is one of the best place for vacation . as a couple we enjoyed the stay . the hotel is near the airport , few minutes walk to kuta beach , kuta market stroll in the evening . spacious lobby , swimming pool on the roof , good speed wifi , smiling reception and swift room service are the good points . rooms are spacious well decorated with good view .#### #### ####[([40], [39], 'POS'), ([49, 50], [48], 'POS'), ([53], [52], 'POS'), ([55, 56, 57], [60], 'POS'), ([63], [65, 66, 67], 'POS'), ([63], [69, 70], 'POS')]
Location is far from the real seminyak area . 45 mins walk . . . Which is different from what has told to us . Breakfast was bad . : ( No wifi in the room . But price is ok and staffs are friendly . They have free shuttle bus to kuta beach everyday at 10am .#### #### ####[([0], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG'), ([25], [27], 'NEG'), ([35], [31, 32], 'NEG'), ([38], [40], 'NEU'), ([42], [44], 'POS')]
I stayed in Le Grande Bali for one week . It was a really relaxing hotel . Really quiet and nice after visiting Kuta . The food is also great and the staff are really friendly .

I stay at this hotel when there were F & B Leader archipelago meeting on 5 & 6 march 2014 , overall I am satisfied and happy with the facilities and services owned by the hotel . breakfast is good enough for 2 star hotel as Fave , with very good service as well from the restaurant staff . Keep it up . . . !#### #### ####[([56, 57], [50], 'POS'), ([51], [50], 'POS'), ([37], [39], 'POS'), ([31], [26], 'POS'), ([29], [24], 'POS'), ([29], [26], 'POS'), ([31], [24], 'POS')]
The rooms are good for the price you pay . But don ' t be fooled by the Kuta association . The beach is not very accessible . If you desperately need to see the sea then there is a walk through the car park of the Mall close to Fave . Nothing much .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([22], [24, 25, 26], 'NEG')]

Stayed here because of the price , proximity to beach - not that great - , lovely pool , good vibes and Lovina center . Average food but good choice in Lovina . As always in Bali - apart from expensive resorts - good Bali coffee . Yea ! ! ! Perhaps the Flores coffee is a little better but all over Indonesia good Arab / Turkish style coffee is to be found .#### #### ####[([26], [25], 'NEU'), ([41], [40], 'NEG'), ([44, 45], [43], 'POS'), ([26], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([20], [19], 'POS'), ([17], [16], 'POS'), ([9], [11, 12, 13], 'NEG'), ([5], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([9], [7], 'POS')]
This old hotel is in the center of the Kuta area and on the beach . The rooms are quite depressing as they are below ground and have no windows . If you only sleep and enjoy the great poolside view the place is OK . Four adults stayed her in the beginning of May 2017 .#### #### ####[([17], [20], 'NEG'), ([17], [24, 25], 'NEG'), ([17], [27, 28, 29], 'NEG'), ([42], [44], 'NEU')]
