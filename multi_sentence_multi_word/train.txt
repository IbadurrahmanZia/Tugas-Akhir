Hotel is normal . The price is cheap . The location acceptable . It is around 4 blocks from the beach and 20 minutes walking to Kuta . Receptionist can be more friendly .

This hotel was very central . It was about 4 stories high . Had been renovated by the looks of it . Nice decor , nice big beds . Lovely rooftop pool .

We used this hotel for overnight transfer and found it very clean and comfortable with very aesthetically appealing decor . Breakfast and service was excellent .

The accomodation was great given the price 30 $ per night i got from booking . com . the hotel was clean and two swiming pools to cool off the bali heat .

the hotel is right on the legian street night life centre but because its inside the allyway so you wouldnt let the music disturb your dream . but when its a rainy day you will be hard to walk there by foot because a lot of water in the hole and the motorbike will make you all wet .#### #### ####[([6, 7, 8, 9], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [36, 37, 38], 'NEG'), ([52], [54, 55, 56, 57], 'NEG')]

I stayed here last week with two friends , we knew that it was quiet isolated which was fine but the restaurant food was dreadful and they ran out mixes for the cocktails .

I do not usually write reviews , though do use the reviews of others on trip advisor to guide me on hotels .

well my stay there was ok but not excellent the room was kept clean and was well insulated enough so i could sleep without the aircon on . had some trouble getting the reception staff to understand requests and they couldn ' t answer most of my queries . the biggest problem though was being woken up before dawn each day by the barracks across the road .#### #### ####[([10], [13], 'POS'), ([10], [16, 17], 'POS')]

Affordable , really friendly staff , nice rooms .

The location is good in a way and has become very fashionable since the noisy , dreadful fins beach club opened up opposite . The beach front breakfast is a lovely event .

this hotel location consider strategy as it was situated not very far from kuta beach . taking a taxi to kuta beach will cost you less than 30k rupiah .

The hotel is reasonably clean but very crowded . It is near some beaches and some culinary places . The breakfast varies every morning .

The hotels was in the middle commercials areas with many empty spaces . Conditions of the surrounding area is not so pleasantly clean and way out from Kuta Beach and Jalan Legian where you can find many restaurants and cafes .

Just one advantage - is a good location near the beach .#### #### ####[([1], [5, 6], 'NEG'), ([1], [9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG'), ([18], [14, 15], 'NEG'), ([21], [20], 'NEG'), ([28], [26, 27], 'NEG'), ([31], [33, 34], 'NEG'), ([36], [38], 'NEG'), ([41], [40], 'NEG'), ([48], [43, 44], 'NEG'), ([60], [59], 'POS'), ([63], [61], 'POS')]
Pros Good location , warm reception , clean rooms , 10 minutes walking to Kuta beach , 5 - 7 minutes walking to Lulu mall , lot of food / spa options just outside the hotel , close to airport and taxi stand , several departmental stores just outside the hotel for daily needs like water , beer , chocolates etc .#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([5], [4], 'POS'), ([8], [7], 'POS'), ([39], [37], 'POS'), ([41, 42], [37], 'POS')]
Overall this hotel is very good . But one thing I can ' t enjoy is the location of the swimming pool is to close to the restaurant , so I don ' t felt comfort when swim there .

Somewhat dirty room , leaking toilet , power cut at 6am for more than 30 minutes ( apparently the engineer wasn ' t there to start the Genset ) and then the water ran out for a further 30 minutes ( as pump had no power .

And all of this comes at a pretty cheap price .#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([6], [5], 'POS'), ([9], [11], 'POS'), ([9], [13], 'POS'), ([29], [24, 25], 'POS'), ([32], [37, 38, 39, 40], 'POS'), ([34, 35], [37, 38, 39, 40], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [49], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [53, 54, 55], 'POS'), ([66], [64, 65], 'POS')]
had to buy my own air freshener . Foul smell coming from the toilet . Furnitures all seem worn out . No lifts . Needs major facelift seriously . My bad for trying this place .

Reality is not reflected by the photos . I think that this place was flash and very nice a few years ago but the room , bathroom and pool area was a bit tatty .

The hotel is truly cute . The small grounds are really lovely on the hill . The restaurant is decent food . But go here for the view . It ' s truly something .

Stay away from this hotel unless you like dingy rooms with no windows , incredible traffic noise , and no room Wifi . The location is central to Kuta , but not near the beach . Traffic is loud .

Great value . Great location . Modern decor . Major let down is no pool to swim in . Well the tiny pool is next to the restaurant and not inviting for swimmers or sunbathers .

Very cheap price for a decent room . The staff were also very helpful and nice . They were professional and follows covid - 19 protocols . The rooms were decent and fitted for its price . However , the twin bedded rooms only have limited ventilation , so it feels humid . I recommend to get the queen sized bed !

I found the rooms to be very old fashioned and needing some personality . The bathroom needed a make over and definitely a new shower curtain .

This is a nice budget friendly hotel in a good location in Kuta , however if you like to laze by the pool for long period ( in the sun ) then you may want to think twice about this hotel .

Stayed here for 5 nights while travelling around Bali and Lombok ! Lovely traditional hotel with a great relaxing swimming pool ! Food wasn ' t great and so we opted to eat elsewhere . When we arrived after a 21 hour journey the hotel were unable to find our booking however they provided us with refreshments while the problem was quickly resolved ! Would defiantly stay here again !#### #### ####[([13, 14], [12], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [17, 18], 'POS'), ([22], [23, 24, 25, 26], 'NEG')]

Before continuing my travel on my arrival from Europe I stayed at this hotel near the airport to handle a jet leg and to relax .

Small , plain and efficient ( somewhat devoid of character ) . A typical business hotel . We think our room was swiped with salt water as the floor was sticky .

This hotel located in a very strategic place , just meters away from beach , the thing is the room quality , somehow it was a bit dusty and can ' t keep away from the street noise , so order second or third floor room to stay ( a bit ) quiet .

Hi , We stayed 2 nights , hotel is typical balinese style so if you looking for modern accommodation is not for you .

Taman Rosani is ideally located close to Jl Petitinget and walking distance to the many nearby restaurants . The rooms are clean with large bath rooms and those near the large pool are my favourite .

Close to the beach , bars and restaurants but still relatively quite . The staff could not be more welcoming and pleasant .

Graet beach views and location .#### #### ####[([39], [41], 'POS'), ([43], [45], 'POS'), ([47], [49, 50], 'NEG'), ([47], [52], 'NEU'), ([55, 56], [54], 'POS'), ([58], [54], 'POS')]

Rooms are comfortable and clean , the food was just exceptable , the actual premises needs a refurb , looking old .

My friends and I had an amazing experience , delightful food and cocktails . Kids enjoyed the kids club , with marshmallows on bonfire , movie nights and many other activities .

With a very affordable rate , Grandmas Seminyak is the perfect selection for our Seminyak ' s trip . The staffs are also very quick to respond to our need .

Decent and isolated hotel with a goal course . Ideal for travelers seeking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Nusa Dua .

On our arrival we did not get the rooms we asked for as they apparently not available . the hotel was to far out and away from tourist areas like Kuta traffic was chaos 40 to 50 min to get6 to Kuta as traffic up that main road at night was bumper to bumper . the pools and hotel not kid friendly in my opinion .#### #### ####[([56], [59, 60, 61], 'NEG'), ([58], [59, 60, 61], 'NEG')]

There is nothing to do in Nuda Dua for a solo traveler . The hotel charges 300 % mark - up for everything including activities . The food sucks and it is definitely not a 5 star .

If you are looking for a cheaper alternative for Bali and do not plan to do much in the hotel , this is for you . The bathrooms were fair size but the room itself was pretty small .

Decent clean hotel in Kuta area . Rooms are spacious . Location is good . Breakfast is below average with less variety . Check in was not smooth . Too less staff according to me .

Other than these , we had a very good time .#### #### ####[([33], [28, 29, 30], 'NEG'), ([43], [47], 'NEG'), ([43], [49], 'NEG'), ([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [5], 'POS'), ([8], [10], 'POS'), ([12], [14], 'POS'), ([12], [16], 'POS'), ([57], [62, 63, 64], 'POS')]
I dont know what the hotel is like but the live music in the bar is fantastic . The restaurant serves great meals at a very cheap price . The staff are helpful and very friendly .

We stayed at The Solaris after getting a good deal online . The room was clean , however needs some good TLC . The bed was big and comfy , the bathroom was basic and in need of some maintenance .

From the beginning , the Ramada Hotel Employees have been greeted well and friendly . Not forgetting the health protocol before we enter the Hotel area . Shown each room with a very refreshing welcome drink . The most impressive thing for me personally and my friends is the friendly service and nuance from the employees , especially Pak Budi and mb Ayu who are always very helpful when we have a need .#### #### ####[([7], [10, 11], 'POS'), ([7], [13], 'POS'), ([24], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 'POS'), ([29], [33, 34, 35], 'POS'), ([55], [49, 50], 'POS'), ([55], [52], 'POS')]

A great choice for budget travelers , as the hotel location is convenient located to Beach Walk and the rooms were clean . The staff speak good English and were very friendly .

Enjoyed a very pleasant stay at this Hotel . Rooms are nice fairly big in size . Although the hotel has only one Restaurant but the food is tasty .
