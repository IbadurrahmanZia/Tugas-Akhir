Stayed here for 1 night when we were unable to board our flight this week since it ’ s right by the airport .,751602005
"The rooms are disappointing , outdated and don ’ t seem very clean .",751602005
No amenities aside from hand soap and bath towels .,751602005
"The ac kept our room cold but dripped all night , we had to stick a trash can underneath it and listen to it drip while we tried to sleep .",751602005
We asked for a nonsmoking room but there was an ash tray in it ( didn ’ t smell though ) .,751602005
"The staff that brought us to the room was not friendly and didn ’ t help us with our bags up many flights of stairs , he just walked far ahead and let us deal with them .",751602005
Breakfast was minimal and not very good .,751602005
Only plus side is location and the pool .,751602005

Great air con that chilled the room quickly .,736659114
Staff were amazing also smiling and quick to joke with us .,736659114
Very honest and highly recommend money change with great rates directly opposite the hotel .,736659114
See Bec in the shop next door for SIM card for your phone .,736659114
Close to lippo mall for the supermarket they are a bit pricey so only went there when I could not access the things I needed in Circle K .,736659114

"We stayed here in Feb 2005 because it was one of the "" package deal "" hotels listed on our booking .",4393020
We didnt expect much as it was a lead in hotel but were very happy with the location .,4393020
It had a clean pool by the meals pavilion .,4393020
Mostly the guests seemed to be more the retiring type so it was very quiet day and night .,4393020
It is located down a lane away from the main road which also helped keep it quiet .,4393020
It was serviced by a strip of shops covering all the basics from internet access to t - shirts and art etc .,4393020
on the way to the main road .,4393020
It was also walking distance to the beach .,4393020
Only a 10 minute walk to the centre of Kuta and in the other direction a fabulous and modern bakery and supermarket owned the Chinese Emporium .,4393020
Surprisingly this shop presented as ultra western with .,4393020

S .,5438719
and flight is very long - - so I want to stay in Bali at least three weeks .,5438719
The staff were all friendly and helpful .,5438719
I felt right at home there and enjoyed the other guests as well .,5438719
Pool was great after a day at the beach .,5438719
"I encountered NO rudeness from any of the staff , and that is unheard of in this day and age .",5438719
"Everyone was eager to help , assist and just have a normal conversation .",5438719
I travel alone for the most part and the hotel is safe and quiet .,5438719
"There are shops along the road and when you want something different than what is on the menu at Bakung ' s , there was a great warung just down the road to the left of Bakung ' s Beach Cottages .",5438719
Staff was friendly there also .,5438719
Right across .,5438719
We booked in to Bakung ' s Beach Cottages based only on price and the fact that we could get adjoining rooms as we wanted to have a two week holiday on a budget .,105053946
"Then we read the reviews here and were a little worried about what to expect ! It was great ! The rooms were basic and old , but they were clean , and cleaned every day ; roomy with a TV and small fridge , and the breakfast which was included in the price was good .",105053946
The kids enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed the loungers beside it .,105053946
"The air cons were great and there were no bugs , insects or vermin ! The hotel is located about 5 mins walk from the beach one way or 2 mins from the main street and 10 mins walk to Waterbom Park and Discovery Plaza .",105053946
We walked up and down the lane at all times of the night with three young kids and never .,105053946
"The hotel room itself should be 4 stars ! : ) it ' s great value for money ! Unfortunately the restaurant in the hotel is shocking ! It deserves 1 star ! The double room was great - it ' s spacious with a big bathroom , flat screen TV ( with cable - good choice of channels ) , big balcony , fridge , wardrobe and free bottles of water every day .",340119793
The rooms were cleaned very well every day even if you asked them to come back at a later time .,340119793
We arrived at 3am but checked in fine ! The location is good and quiet down a side road .,340119793
"It ' s right next to the Lippo Mall ( 2 mins ) which has a supermarket , cinema and restaurants .",340119793
It ' s a short walk to the beach - however this is down a shady alleyway where you wouldn ' t like to walk at night but it ' s fine in the day .,340119793
With our room price we had free .,340119793
I stayed here for the 1st time late 2011 into 2012 and overall this place is pretty good .,124637732
"iI am not one of these people who spend alot of time in my room , but when you are in there the bed is clean , sheets change each day and the room is cool from the A / C .",124637732
"Now we go to the pool area which is great , the water in the pool is clean and around there during the day is quite social with the other guest staying there .",124637732
The pool bar does not open but the restuarant is right there if you want a drink or food .,124637732
The gardens around the hotel are amazing .,124637732

Just saying ! Jiffy .,124637732
I have stayed at Bakung Beach Cottages several times over the past 3 years .,121724578
It is an adequate stay for the Traveller on a budget or someone just looking for a nice cool room to rest between sessions at the many of the islands clubs .,121724578
To all out there who label it the worst place or horrible I suggest stop being a cheapskate and fork out the extra $ 250 for something 5 star .,121724578
Best budget hotel in Bali fantastic staff from management to cleaners couldnt do enough for us .,117884167
Hotel needs an upgrade but for the price you pay well worth it .,117884167
We wouldnt hesitate to stay at this hotel again speciial thanks to manager Nyoman a truly special man .,117884167
Doesn ’ t make much sense to be booked into your flash south Bali hotel / resort first night if your flight arrives post 20 .,685101496
"00 – you have paid for the great view , rim pool , gym , restaurant yada but all you will see on late arrival ( add at least an hour for the airport and the trip from , although the latter can be much more in South Bali ' s horrendous pre - midnight traffic ) is the inside of your hotel room for a short while ( hopefully ) – before the zzzzs kick in .",685101496
Way better to head for a near - airport lower midrange place with quiet comfy rooms .,685101496
Which BAKUNG does well .,685101496
"Similarly if your flash resort is anywhere north of halfway to UBUD or south - west of BALANGAN , you don ’ t want to spend more than an hour ANYTIME OF DAY squashed up in a cab or resort shuttle after a long tiring flight .",685101496
In about 20 trips to Bali this is the worst hotel I have stayed at .,295558103
Thought I would try it for 2 nights as the pictures through Agoda ( & other booking sites ) looked good .,295558103
I have stayed at a lot more expensive and a couple cheaper .,295558103
In my second room after complaining about the 1st and am now looking forward to tomorrow morning to book out and go elsewhere .,295558103
"The rooms are dirty , the not plugged in fridge was filthy with mould and other substances in it .",295558103
The sheets and towels - which none have been left from making the room up this morning - are threadbare and a dirty colour .,295558103
Have just watched 2 older women cart their bags up 3 flights of stairs .,295558103
Staff are not rude but of no help .,295558103
The rooms I have seen are old and depressing with no safe to lock things in .,295558103
Breakfast is just passable .,295558103
I ' m writing this review at the same time as we are staying here .,227816563
This is a place that is clearly on the way up .,227816563
"We noted all the bad older reviews before we got here and the better recent ones , and that pretty much tells the story .",227816563
It seems there must ' ve been LOTS of improvements over the past few months .,227816563
"Yep , there ' s still a bit to go , but for the price , this place is a gem .",227816563
"Nice pool w / swim up bar , clean rooms with king size beds ( and air con ) and lovely gardens , it ' s a perfect place to radiate from for your Bali stay .",227816563
The cons : Water pressure a little light on the top ( third ) floor .,227816563
Still some broken tiles in the pool ( though they ' re not really dangerous ) .,227816563
Breakfast choices maybe a bit lean for some .,227816563
The odd mangy cat floating thru the grounds .,227816563
The pros : THE PRICE ! We booked .,227816563
I have stayed here each time I arrive in Bali and find Bakung ' s Beach Hotel to be comfortable and affordable accommodation close to the airport .,209982822
This is really convenient when arriving later at night as it saves a long trip in to the Kuta / Legian area at a time when the traffic is not flowing quickly .,209982822
There are also two shopping malls close by .,209982822
The new Lippomall is right next door and the Discovery Mall a 15 minute walk away .,209982822
Bakung ' s Beach Hotel is not on the beach but quite close and access to the waterfront is possible through the Pantai Inn restaurant grounds .,209982822
"The rooms have a small fridge , cable TV , bedside tables and good bedside lighting .",209982822
The cupboard space has varied in the different rooms I have stayed in .,209982822
Each room has a terrace area with a table and two chairs .,209982822
The .,209982822
Checked in to this hotel last night and we had paid for 2 nights .,107068313
The room was filthy and smelt of moth balls .,107068313
I didn ' t want to use the bathroom or lay my head on the pillows .,107068313
It was so terrible that we decided to move hotels .,107068313
"The hotel advertises its rack rates at AUD $ 60 , but you can find it advertised for cheaper on other sites .",107068313
"I ' ve travelled in Vietnam and stayed in budget accommodation , paying around US $ 20 per night .",107068313
"; I wouldn ' t pay USD $ 20 for this place , or anymore than AUD $ 15 ! I don ' t think it provides good value for money .",107068313
It would be an okay place to sleep if you can overlook its tiredness and general grottiness .,107068313
"Given the competition for western business , this place needs to lift its game .",107068313
It ' s a hidden gem tucked away the reception is a decent climb up many stairs you are greeted with a refreshing smile and very cold drink .,467159630
The rooms are very neat and clean this hotel recently had an upgrade and the bathrooms are very big and clean the restaurant is basic but the food is amazing the best is the MI goreng the pool is very large and has a swim up bar .,467159630
the beach is about a 5 minute walk and the main street is at the end of the lane all the stall sellers on the street are lovely for a cheap hotel I can ' t knock it I have been to this hotel about 6 times and I ' m drawn back by the relaxing feeling I get from it .,467159630
Excellent location right next to the new lippo mall .,304503322
We had a room the backed into the mall and the motorbikes starting at 6am going into the car park and all the talking behind us was painful .,304503322
Room was not cleaned to my liking .,304503322
Breakfast was poor at best .,304503322
Stayed with friends who woke up covered in bed bug bites .,304503322
Kids used the pool and within seconds were screaming about the water in their eyes .,304503322
"Told them just not to put their heads under the water , but then when they got out the were covered in chemical burns ( all the kids 6 in total so not just a one off child with sensitive skin ! ) the pool bar was not open , and restaurant staff would not even walk the two steps down yo the pool to serve us drinks .",304503322
"Checked out and told staff all our issues , and no apology just said no refund .",304503322
I have used this property in the past for a stop over being close to the Airport & Kuta attractions which makes life easy .,217696913
Booking online has been easy & so affordable that there is money in the pocket to get out & see Bali .,217696913
"People that put up bad comments about this place must have expected four star resort at a Budget price ? I just brought my family here on my last visit , we had two connecting rooms & went out and did tours during the day & home to sit around the pool .",217696913
Kids loved it .,217696913
New Lippo mall next door .,217696913
"Resturant Pantai down on the beach & it ' s 6 , 000 rup ' s ( 50c ) to catch a blue cab to Kuta square .",217696913
We also stayed in a luxury resort as part of our Bali holiday but we will be back to Bakung Beach again in the future .,217696913
For a surfer this is a great location just 100meters to the boats out to the kuta reefs .,207804376
"I have been to this hotel on numerous occasions and the staff have not changed and are as friendly as always rooms have been painted , bathrooms updated and satelite TV installed also buffett breakfast that will keep you going if you are on a budget and happy with a simple menu .",207804376
Bakung Beach hotel is not the Hilton but the $ 1500 i saved went a long way to my wifes Shopping and my Bintang expenditure .,207804376
Pool and area around pool have been refurbished with new lounges .,207804376
"If you want to stay and lie around the pool all day and stay in your room hrs on end then go to a five star resort , but if you need a base to shower and catch some sleep in between your touring and shopping that is clean and .",207804376
I ' ve stayed here a number of times now and every time it ' s a great experience .,207070237
"It is evident with the influence of my long time friend Robert Rajendra , the GM of the Bakungs group of hotels , this humble hotel is reaching for the stars .",207070237
"My first experience was with fairly dingy rooms and a breakfast menu that was laughable , albeit sufficient .",207070237
"The hotel has undergone significant building renovations and very recently , an upgrade to the guest facilities that incorporated a complete make over of the pool area .",207070237
"The introduction of a coffee corner , swim up bar revamp and overhaul of the breakfast menu makes the Bakungs outrageous value for money .",207070237
Close to the airport with transport arrangements it ' s a ripper .,207070237
"Yes , there ' s still the quaint engineering skills which bring a smile , .",207070237
It all depends what you are looking for ! We have been coming to this hotel now for a number of years and although old and in need of a good upgrade it is happening .,142685672
We are currently staying here and the manager showed us one of the rooms that are almost finished being upgraded and what with the new tiling floor to ceiling in the bathroom .,142685672
"With new washbasins and toilet pedestals lovely floor tiles throughout , the finished product will be lovely .",142685672
We are .,142685672
pensioners and can not afford to stay in the other upmarket hotels and would recommend this hotel to anyone who are not over fussy .,142685672
I can not speak more highly of the friendliness of the manager and his staff ( and no I am not on the payroll ) .,142685672
Pool is lovely and the gardens pretty except for the moment while the upgrade is in .,142685672
this was the first time staying at Bakungs and have to say that i was suprised .,130559223
"after reading the reviews was expecting the worse , yes its old and a little mouldy but the air con worked well and the sheets were clean .",130559223
the staff are friendly and the highlight had to be the breakfast each day .,130559223
considering how little it cost to stay i have paid more and stayed in worse .,130559223
for those who see the room as some where to sleep and save their money for shopping i would recommend Bakung Beach catherine .,130559223
I stayed here for a week with a friend on my uni holidays .,116001939
"Since we were on a budget , I was quite sceptical about a low star hotel .",116001939
"The hotel is absolutely beautiful , with amazing gardens , beautiful Balinese architecture and a great pool .",116001939
"The rooms are very basic , but totally fine .",116001939
"Comfy enough beds , good air con , good shower ( although the bathroom was very small ) and a TV .",116001939
"The only problem was that the walls are quite thin , and the floor is made of tiles and often we heard out neighbours ( moving furniture ? ) in the middle of the night and yelling / partying etc but I guess that was just bad luck .",116001939
Staff are also very friendly and helpful .,116001939
havent heard the best things about bakung but I really enjoyed my stay .,92852386
"staff were fantastic so happy friendly and helpful , the rooms were cleaned everyday , room was basic with a bed small tv mirror and bathroom the balcony was nice to sit on and look at the beautiful garden .",92852386
the pool was really nice a decent size with a kiddie area but the tiles are abit slippery and some corners are a lil sharp .,92852386
breakfast was pritty basic but decent to get u through till lunch u cant expect to much from 20 bucks a night i really enjoyed my stay the staff definetly added to the experience .,92852386
This hotel is a bit run down but it is cheap and ideally situated .,74857121
It is only a short drive from the airport which is what you want when youa rrive jet lagged ! It is 10 minutes walk to the beginning of the main Kuta area and five minutes walk from the beautiful Tuban beach .,74857121
The thing to do is by some bleach and clean the bathroom to your own standards .,74857121
Don ; t get me wrong - it is not filthy ! but you will feel better if you do this .,74857121
Make sure the grating is fixed over the drain in the bathroom otherwise you will get rats coming up through the hole .,74857121
Bali has many rats and Bakung ' s Beach has its fair share .,74857121
Free entertainmentt is watching them running along the rafters .,74857121
The cats seem to ignore them ! ! The hotel has a good sized pool .,74857121
We didn ' t try the food but for excellent .,74857121
Booked two rooms for our family and were very pleased with our stay .,29162261
The rooms were very basic but served their purpose as we did not spend much time in them at all .,29162261
We had to ask for pool and bath towels as sometimes they were not left in our room .,29162261
The pool area was lovely although they need new and more sun lounges .,29162261
The breakfast was very basic and gave you a choice of egg styles i .,29162261
e scrambled etc .,29162261
"bacon or ham , toast or honey pancake .",29162261
Or Asian breakfast ( which we never had ) .,29162261
The honey pancake was very good .,29162261
We ate a few times at the restaurant for snacks and dinner and the food was very good .,29162261
In particular their pizza wasdelicious especially the ' alla romanna ' .,29162261
The trip from the airport was only about 10 mins and we were within walking distance to Centro and .,29162261
This is a horrible place to stay ! I booked here to be with friends who had booked a stay .,493882930
I should have left after the first night .,493882930
Room changes because of the poor condition then air conditioning breaking down .,493882930
Dirty bathroom and poorly operating hot water ( too hot then too cold ) .,493882930
The breakfast is rubbish .,493882930
"Pool was over chlorinated , and not enough deck chairs .",493882930
"If you want a hotel with a nice pool , this is not it .",493882930
On the positive it is beside a nice mall .,493882930
"However , if you happen to have a room backing onto it the car park is noisy at night like a construction site .",493882930
Poorly lit rooms and very basic .,493882930
At night I could here rats or squirrels in the ceiling .,493882930
"I ' ll give credit where credit is due , see my other reviews , but a stay here will put a dark cloud over your .",493882930
Prior booking I read numerous negative reviews of this place .,492638943
"I knew what I was getting myself into but decided to go ahead due the close proximity to Lippo Mall , Kuta Beach and to the Bali night life .",492638943
I have to agree that a lot of what other ppl mention in the past reviews were true but it was not all that bad .,492638943
Since I am out the entire day and only come back late at night to sleep I am pretty pleased with the place .,492638943
"Yes , on my first night the air condition leaked and the bathroom was clogged but it was quickly resolved by friendly staff members .",492638943
Breakfast was decent and nothing to complaint about .,492638943
I would recommend this place to those who just want a decent place to come back to to sleep after a long day out and about traveling and shopping around Bali .,492638943
If you are looking for .,492638943
I love everything about this hotel .,457745719

"The staff ( Marni etc on the front desk to Wayan , Wayan Sari , Ayu and Argung looking after us at breakfast - to name just a few ) were lovely and so very happy and always so welcoming .",324315173
Thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts and the pool .,324315173
"The hotel location was also excellent for us being so close to Lippo Mall for shopping , a lazy 15 minute walk to Discovery Mall and Kuta , 5 minutes to the beach for a sunset walk .",324315173
It is a fine hotel central in the Kuta South area nothing fancy but clean and tidy .,323343135
This is a good hotel if you are on a budget or just want to do it cheap .,323343135
The staff are great people pleasant and will have a bit of a laugh with you .,323343135

Was a good location and not too noisy .,298999201
"Will definitely go back and take kids next year , definitely worth the money you pay .",298999201
If you ’ re on a budget this is excellent value for money in a great location .,250458639
If you ’ re after 5 star luxury with a lap pool go somewhere else .,250458639
Rooms – spacious with old balinese furniture .,250458639

Can be boring if staying for a lengthy holiday .,250458639
"Staff – fantastic , .",250458639
We first came here 12 years ago and keep coming back .,247485586
Rooms are comfortable with aircon and a balcony .,247485586
Excellent pool and friendly staff .,247485586
"Cooked eggs , selection of 3 hot dishes , fruit , fruit juice , toast and coffee for breakfast , all for Rp50 , 000 if it isn ' t already included with your room rate .",247485586
Only a few minutes walk to the quiet Tuban Beach away from the madness of Kuta and the same distance to the beachside Pantai Restaurant .,247485586
Great food at a great price .,247485586
"we just kept going back ! For a far more up - market or special occasion meal or drinks , there is Ma Joly right next door to Pantai .",247485586
From Bakung you can walk to the Discovery Centre or Kuta along the beach walkway instead of the busy street .,247485586
Plus there is the large Lippo Mall right next door .,247485586
I booked for 2 nights as a layover at the end of my holiday .,237192799
Arrived at lunchtime with my two children ( 6 & 8 ) and was shown to a double room despite me asking for enough beds for three people .,237192799
After much negotiation I ended up with two single beds .,237192799
They wanted me to pay for an extra single despite booking for 1 adult and 2 children .,237192799
Room at first glance was acceptable .,237192799
Then it just went downhill .,237192799
- doors are not sealed and have big gaps under and around so mozzies just fly in and out as they please .,237192799
"- floor was filthy , sandy and grouting is gross .",237192799
"- wardrobes are circa 1950 , smell terrible and don ' t close .",237192799
- lighting is appalling .,237192799
They flicker crazily and yet at night the room isn ' t dark at all due to the windows over both doors and lights on outside .,237192799
- bathroom .,237192799
This is a cheap hotel in good location with reasonable rooms but we found ours on the 3rd floor to be a bit noisy as it backed onto the car park and air con units from the new Lippo Mall next door .,214747320
"The rooms are well fitted out and are reasonably clean , do get the normal Bali smell coming up the shower drain , fixed by putting rubber door mat over it .",214747320
"The pool is only small and there is not enough sun beds and shade for the amount of people who wish to use it , it also has no pool towels so use ones from room so have to ask for extra towels .",214747320
"The breakfast is limited and caters more for locals , rice and noodle dishes along with toast etc and fruit .",214747320
You can ask for eggs any style and bacon but no variety .,214747320
Generally the staff were great and helpfull but found reception hard to .,214747320
Well what can i say the hotel is amazing for the price .,207448181
$ 23 a night including breakfast .,207448181
It doesnt get much better than that .,207448181
If this hotel was closer to the main Kuta drag you would pay at least $ 60 per night .,207448181
Location is great if you are wanting to surf Kuta reef .,207448181
5 mins on the scooter and your in the heart of Kuta .,207448181
"Some great little shops , massage nails etc outside the hotel .",207448181
"Pool is fantastic , Rooms clean and modern , Free wifi , Sattelite tv .",207448181
Awesome .,207448181
Breakfast is ok you have to ask for them to cook you eggs otherwise its just the buffet .,207448181
Nice clean and cheap hotel to stay in .,201968109
The Room was a big room with a balcony to sit and watch the world go by .,201968109
Comfortable and with hot showers .,201968109
Reception area was a bit of a nightmare as it is at the top of some stairs .,201968109
After looking through the reviews I must say I completely disagree with KYLIES negative review .,186211023
If she wanted 5 star service she should ' ve paid for it .,186211023
Well located off Jl Kartika Plaza 5 minutes from Nurah Rai International airport .,186211023
This budget hotel has improved immensely since the arrival of the new GM with experience from a close by 5 star resort .,186211023
"Don ' t let the price put you off , the staff are always smiling , friendly and willing to help .",186211023
The rooms have recently been renovated .,186211023
If you don ' t like your room on arrival ask to be relocated .,186211023
I feel this establishment is rated very fairly and I ' ll be surprised if by stays end you haven ' t enjoyed yourself .,186211023
We stumbled across this hotel on agoda and got a very cheap deal .,184207132
"The rooms are large , clean and spacious and have comfy beds ! Hotel is very central and very close to the airport .",184207132
Downside is the restaurant is not great and there are not enough sun loungers by the pool .,184207132
"The service is fantastic from when you arrive , staff are warm , welcoming and helpful .",184207132
We were greeted by a friendly security guard and were checked in quickly with a welcome drink .,176944786
The porter and security helped us carry our bags to the room which was nice .,176944786
We stayed in a deluxe double room and it was OK .,176944786
"It was clean enough with a bed , wardrobe , tv , shower , air con and balcony with a view of the pool .",176944786
The room was cleaned daily and we were given bottled water each day .,176944786
There is also free wifi which was good .,176944786
The bad thing about the room was that we had a connecting door to another room and we could hear everything they said and the tv which was annoying at 7am when we wanted to sleep .,176944786
"We paid for breakfast and there was toast , fruit , rice , noodles , juice and hot drinks .",176944786
You can request an omelette or other eggs if you wish .,176944786
We ate in the same restaurant at lunch .,176944786
Bali obviously has some very impressive resorts on offer .,171419976
"Although this isn ' t one of the typical 5 star places , it is definitely more than enough .",171419976
"It is fortunately located at the quieter end of Kuta , but a short walk if you want to go into central Kuta .",171419976
"Staff very friendly , rooms basic , but have everything you need - comfortable bed , air con , TV with multiple channels , and wifi .",171419976
"The pool area is nice , and great after a morning surfing .",171419976
They could provide a few more sun loungers though .,171419976
Overall a great budget - luxury place to stay - really great value for money .,171419976
"This place suits couples on a budget that have done the whole hostel thing a few years back , but still like backpacking .",171419976
Close to a really great surf spot ( accessible by boat .,171419976
) .,171419976
we stayed there as a party of 3 .,150752275
booked efficiently through asia rooms .,150752275
VERY REASONABLE PRICE - APPROX 35 USD PER SUPERIOR ROOM - very attentive and kind staff .,150752275
grand entrance with a 4 star pool .,150752275
rooms were comfortable but yes a bit dated but we liked the outside space overlooking their gardens .,150752275
un pretentious atmosphere .,150752275
mixture of young and old just enjoying the atmosphere and location - 5 minutes either way to kuta beach or down town .,150752275
2 star prices for 4 star comfort ! ! ! ! ! .,150752275
I came with my family to Bali and decided at the last minute to stay in Kuta on our last night .,148688286
"it was the last day of the year , and all the nice hotels we inquired were fully booked .",148688286
We surfed through internet and found only this hotel in the Kuta area that still have available rooms .,148688286
"we were quoted Rp600 , 000 / room / night .",148688286
"When we went to check - in an hour later , we were told the rate was Rp700 , 000 .",148688286
"After we insisted that it wasn ' t the rate we were initially given , the unfriendly lady behind the counter finally gave in .",148688286
"When asked if we could get adjacent rooms , she said ok .",148688286
"But when we got our keys , we were given rooms at different floors , and she had no courtesy to even explain or apologize for not being able to give us what we requested .",148688286
She required cash for deposit so i gave .,148688286
"Ok now this place was old but it was cheap and it matched its dollar value , the rooms were clean and the bathroom as clean as they could get it , but the bathrooms are in seriouse need of an up grade , but back to $ value again it ' s ok .",130403625
The towels were clean but grey .,130403625
"One thing that was weird was all the light switches were filthy , they took the trouble to clean everything else but these looked like they hadn ' t been cleaned for 20 years , I just sprayed them with glen 20 .",130403625
The pool and the grounds were lovely and staff polite but not over friendly like Balanese normaly are .,130403625
"I ' d still recommend this if your on a budget , you don ' t spend much time in your room .",130403625
PS no coffee or tea facilities in the rooms or water .,130403625
"Stayed here with 2 of my siblings , booked 8 nights for £ 169 which was an absolute bargain ! It is spacious , big pool , large rooms and so close to everything such as shopping malls , markets , beach etc .",596478186
Overall had a good stay but it is a little tired .,596478186
"Some missing tiles in the pool , not enough sunbeds for such a large hotel & room not really as described .",596478186
We expected to have a deluxe superior room with 3 single beds in as that is how it is described on booking .,596478186
com but we just had 1 double bed with 2 mattresses stacked on top of each other for the 3rd bed .,596478186
Not really good enough & we probably wouldn ' t have booked had we have known this .,596478186
You get for you pay for at Bakungs .,581303283
You get AC and the balcony often comes with garden view .,581303283
"The rooms are just clean enough , some are better than others though and very simple .",581303283
The drain in the bathroom doesn ` t work well and the water can be boiling hot .,581303283
"But it ` s walking distance to the surf , it ` s quiet and yet close to the main road , Lippo mall and restaurants .",581303283
There is a nice pool and a beautiful garden .,581303283
What can I say .,549405211
Overall the hotel is bad .,549405211
At night their are no lights to help you to see where you are going .,549405211
You have to climb up so many stairs to get to the main reception .,549405211
"The service is shocking , not very heplful .",549405211
Not for the handicap person or the elderly people .,549405211
The pathway is dangerous and not level at all .,549405211
slippery when raining or wet .,549405211
You can either choose to use the steps or the steep path to go down to the rooms .,549405211
You choose .,549405211
There are no lifts only more stairs to get to the first floor .,549405211
The rooms are very basic .,549405211
The bedding was hard .,549405211
The bathroom was as basic as it comes and dirty .,549405211
No kettle and the air was loud and it was very hard to fall asleep .,549405211
Next morning we went for breakfast with my sister and her husband .,549405211
It was an average breakfast .,549405211
Would not recommend .,549405211
Quality of premises is bad .,544278109
Staffs are friendly but not knowledgeable .,544278109
Definitely not handicap friendly .,544278109
Bedding was hard .,544278109
Towels were clean .,544278109
Breakfast isn ’ t recommended at all .,544278109
There ’ s a good and cheap massage place right across the road though .,544278109
We ' ve booked a room for 3 persons .,531121159
When we came in there were only 2 beds and one matras on the ground .,531121159
The pictures on the website did show uw a room with 3 normal beds .,531121159
When we ' ve asked for a normal bed it was really difficult to get it .,531121159
"The staff were really unfriendly at the reception , haven ' t seen a smile at all .",531121159
Eventually we ' ve got the extra bed .,531121159
"The rooms were really dirty , there were a lot of string of hair on the ground .",531121159
Like if they did not swipe the room for a month .,531121159
We had cockrouches in our bathroom and a lot of mult .,531121159
Also the shower was cold .,531121159
The fridge did not work at all .,531121159
The only nice thing was the pool with the bar inside .,531121159
We were glas we ' ve only booked for one night .,531121159
"Never going back to this place again , no one should .",531121159
"We Booked 4 rooms , 2 with extra beds for our family .",530082607
"The pool whilst large had many broken , sharp tiles and the ph levels were obviously well off as many eye and skin irritations .",530082607
The rooms whilst spacious were poorly equipped and bathrooms in a very poor state .,530082607
Air cons worked quite well .,530082607
Tom cats everywhere which urinated on 1 of our doors leaving an aroma which could not be removed and infiltrated the room .,530082607
Breakfast was adequate but not great .,530082607
Worst feature was the shocking bed bug bites our 9 year old received .,530082607
He was covered in them and his holiday quite spoilt .,530082607
This is a low price hotel and we didn ’ t expect a lot but this issue was inexcusable .,530082607
I am still currently ill from visiting Bali 6 months ago and I feel like this place has a lot to do with it .,493740830
Our room had two single beds pushed together .,493740830
Breakfast was terrible as bees were everywhere .,493740830
Over 4 cats that will literally walk into your room but all were very lovely .,493740830
"Two male staff members were so lovely - they added us on Facebook at the end of our trip but upon going through their photos they go though guests rooms and take funny pictures with their items - alcohol , sunglasses .",493740830
I found this very unprofessional .,493740830
Bathroom was clogged and sewage came up the shower drain .,493740830
Was told this would be fixed - it took the whole day and stunk of poo .,493740830
The next day the same thing happened .,493740830
Went down to reception and got placed in a new room - no problems with clogging in this .,493740830
"recently stayed at Bakung Beach Resort , Do not give them your bank account details they access your account without your knowledge charge a extra day plus $ 10 not sure what that was for and refuse to give back the money ) is no way I would recommend anyone to stay here it ' s true what they say you get what you pay for but you certainly don ' t expect this , there is no jug or coffee facilities , would not stay there with children , The kids pool has tiles falling off it my daughter picked out tiles and would ' ve filled half a will Barra , There is a swim bar but however it ' s not open , The surrounds around the pool is dangerous , I watched a woman fall over poor furniture and split her head open got wedged between the steps going into the breakfast room and the pool surrounds .",487680012

the people at bakungs are the best and so is this hotel .,487192308
we always come back .,487192308

Here are some of the pros and cons of our stay : Pros : Location - it is conveniently located in the same street as the Lippo mall which has a nice big supermarket with everything you need .,426871952

Breakfast is also basic toast fruit tea and coffee .,216138052
There is a nice pool area .,216138052
My husband surfs and this is very close to Kuta Reef and the airport .,216138052
If you haven ' t been to Bali before I would suggest you look elsewhere .,216138052
I found it fine but not the Ritz .,216138052
"I was captured by the 100m to beach description , yes you are 100 meters to the beach , but then another solid 1 - 2 km from the real beach .",215449835
Walking distance to shopping though .,215449835
"Rooms clean , brekky is rice .",215449835
"Descent , but there is better for similar prices .",215449835
"I also didn ' t like the little ally it was on , as a blonde I was frequently harassed by store keepers .",215449835
I would google map double six beach or hard rock hotel and pick places near them .,215449835
"Far from each other , but best beach locations .",215449835
Myself and my girlfriend booked ourselves into this hotel last minute so choices were very short and this had the best recent reviews so we thought it must be quite a nice hotel ! Boy were we wrong ! We arrived and were greeted with complimentary drinks which was a nice start but it went downhill from there .,208646889
"We were showed to our room which was a rather long walk so my girlfriend had to carry her large travel bag all that way without an offer from any staff to carry it which was rather ignorant considering all other hotels we have been in so far have done that ! The room itself looked nice , however the a / c didn ' t work properly so it was freezing ! The showers drain was awful so water didn ' t drain properly ! The bed ' s mattress was really hard and I ' m sure some springs were broken ! The .",208646889
Our stay from 11 May2014 to 17 May 2014 .,206729556
Superior twin Room .,206729556
"Although the Hotel now no longer has a beach front nor sight of the Sea ( a 5 min walk is now needed to access the Beach ) , this is a rustic and serene peace of property that is value for Money .",206729556
"For less than US30 with breakfast thrown in you get a restful stay after a hectic touring day , The courtyard pool and generous matured landscaped garden with total privacy from the outside is much appreciated .",206729556
The Pool may be small but clean ; actually deep enough and nice with a small shallow section at one corner for children .,206729556
One can even do some mini laps and soak away all tired limbs .,206729556
Adjacent is a basic restaurant operating from 7am to 10pm and in the day a seperate coffee bar as well .,206729556

I stayed here 15 years ago on boys surfing holidays and just stayed again with my 10 yr old son and a mate .,198975217
"Rooms clean , ac worked , nice big balcony , maintained gardens , new shopping center next door for all your needs , quick walk to beach , massage and laundry across the lane Pool needs to be retiled sharp edges and alot of broken and missing tiles , more room around pool would be good Seriosly you cant complain when you pay $ 30 a night Yes i would stay here again .",198975217
Value for money .,189571380
AC is good .,189571380
Hot water is good .,189571380
Very large bed .,189571380
"Large and spacious room , Friendly staff , Large swimming pool , Large garden , Good location , located right behind Lippo Mall Kuta , a brand new large shopping mall in Kuta .",189571380
A lot of food available in their food court .,189571380
Staff were friendly upon arrival but that is where the positives ended .,186794465
The room was old & outdated & we had to go up 2 flights of stairs to get there .,186794465
There are stray cats living on the grounds ( we saw at least 6 ) .,186794465
The room was infested with Mosquitos & my friend had bed bugs in her bed .,186794465
"The room is noisy by day & by night , during the night all you can hear is traffic , screaming from the streets & power tools being used at all hours .",186794465
We didnt even attempt to use the pool as it didnt look appealing & we went to have brekkie at the hotel restaurant but were stared down by other patrons / staff & the food didnt look good so we went elsewhere .,186794465
This hotel is more of a hostel & would barely be fit for a backpacker .,186794465
Save your money & go for something a bit classier because this .,186794465
Simple small hotel and yeah they are not that organised at times but it is good location for the cost which was around Aus $ 25 / night .,186596097
The rooms are basic and nothing flash and you might have to get some glasses for yourself but there are little almost private balconies or terraces .,186596097
The bed is a little too firm but have had that at expensive hotels .,186596097
there is aircon and a fridge .,186596097
Location is tucked away from noisy street and close to beach and Kartiki plaza shopping / restaurants etc .,186596097

"my wife and i love bali , its culture and lifestyle .",183336044
we wanted a traditional balinese hotel to stay in .,183336044
this is bakungs hotel .,183336044
"not expensive , friendly with a nice atmosphere , beautiful gardens , pool and a nice restaurant .",183336044
i have a bit of advice for new travellers in this new world .,183336044
at check in ask to inspect your room to see if it is ok .,183336044
if the room is not what you want ask for another .,183336044
the staff at bakungs did that for us and our room was excellent .,183336044
all the staff are just good people and we found them very helpful .,183336044
like all hotels in the world there will always be problems for certain people .,183336044
these problems are not difficult to solve .,183336044
we love this hotel and i would have our next visit to bali penned in at bakungs hotel .,183336044

"Location is very near to airport , just less than 10 minutes away .",182172474
"Good localtion in Kuta , walking distant to attractions .",182172474
We stayed here for one night before an early flight the next morning .,181442748
The price for the rooms was outstanding but yes it is a little tired and dated but clean enough .,181442748
The pool was large and clean and the food very reasonably priced .,181442748
"I would consider staying here again as long as our room did not back onto the new shopping centre , as the air conditioning unit was loud and it was hard to get to sleep .",181442748
There are a lot of stairs which you may need to consider if you struggle with them .,181442748
Overall if you are not too fussy this would satisfy a family on a budget holiday .,181442748
Short walk to the beach 150 Metres .,172992949
Next door to a brand new shopping complex currently filling with tenants .,172992949
Great SuperMarket in the basement .,172992949
Short walk to Discovery plaza and Kuta square .,172992949
Either by Beach Boardwalk or Main st .,172992949
Far enough away from the hustle and bustle .,172992949

The included breakfast is very good .,166454674

", Bakung hotel has a lovely swimming pool , quite large beside the restraunt .",166454674
"If you are coming to Bali , we recommend Bakung Beach Hotel , if you wish to stay in the Kuta area , it is up a narrow street , and is very quiet .",166454674
"We stayed here on our return before flying home also , as for price for value , a bit hard to better .",166454674
This is my first visit into the reno ' d section of BBC .,165137046
Remember this is a 1 - 2 * hotel The room I was allocated was close to the pool and amenities although Twin share they pushed the beds together .,165137046
Never works ; ) .,165137046
The bathroom was clean neat and tidy although the engineering meant that water from the shower collected around the pan .,165137046
"More towels please ! ! Didi I care ! No , at around 35 a night it ' s not 5 * quality .",165137046
Ill be coming back .,165137046
Nice to see lots more Aussies and families .,165137046
Pools always good and well kept .,165137046
"We had a fabulous stay , the best location , close to the beach .",158568348

"The rooms were all that you could want , the facilities were good and clean linen every day , the towels needed an update .",158568348
Great relaxing by the pool or overlooking the garden for our family .,158568348

Bakung was way above my expectations after staying * * * * * star last trip .,158568348
This will be the 4th time I ' ve stayed at Bakungs .,146055449
"I ' ve always found the staff pleasant , ready to help and eager to serve .",146055449
"I must say , for a 2 * hotel it compares with some higher rated establishments .",146055449
"Maybe not as up to date , with older facilities and mountainous front office steps that are slippery after rains BUT its hard to argue against clean linen daily , room fridge , good air con lovely little pool that ' s well maintained and close to everything .",146055449
I mean where else is all this including a fair breakfast for less that $ AUD40 a night ? .,146055449
We stayed at this motel and reviewed it 12 months ago .,129275190
"We had such a nice time , we returned in April this year .",129275190
"The motel is looking older and is more rundown ; with building going on beside it , it is also noisy during the day .",129275190
"The bathroom was not just old , it is mouldy and leaking .",129275190
"That said , the aircon worked well , the beds were clean , we had no bugs or vermin and at all times felt safe and welcome .",129275190
The swimming pool is old ( broken tiles in places ) but water quality was great and the kids loved it .,129275190
We had no problems with breakfast and we love the laundry service directly across the lane .,129275190
"We paid about $ 50 AUS for two connecting rooms , sleeping 6 .",129275190
"It ' s budget , away from the crowds but 10 minutes walk to Waterbom and Discovery Plaza and 3 minute to the beach .",129275190
We would still .,129275190
I stayed here with my cousin for 8 nights in November 2011 .,128029559
"We checked into our ground floor room and was disgusted ! Dirty , VERY smelly .",128029559
"After complaining we were moved to another room on the top floor , a little better but not much at all .",128029559
The bathrooms were the worst I ' ve seen .,128029559
"Friends at a near by hotel left several messages with reception and we never received them , also our phone didn ' t work and we complained AFTER our friends had left messages and still they didn ' t let us know ! Then tried to charge us some ridiculous price to use their reception phone to call a local number .",128029559
Didn ' t bother with the breakfast after our first try had ants crawling all over the plate .,128029559
"Bed bugs , towels gray with holes .",128029559
I could go on and on but I ' ll leave it as my worst travel experience .,128029559
"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel 2 yr ago and it was budget but clean , this time was tataly different .",127344013
The room was dirty and the bed was full of flees .,127344013
"My wife was bitten by the flees and required attention at the international hospital , then had to endure a treatment having to cover the bits with a cream and taking ant - histermens lasting 1 week .",127344013
We were moved to another room at 3 am the roof leaked when it rained .,127344013
"The hotel would not pay for the doctors and asked to be payed for the nights we stayed which I refused and had to get the tourist police involved , we move to a clean hotel and completed our trip .",127344013
Three things you need to stay at this hotel .,127344013
• Good health insurance • Next hotel booked as you will require movement • Local Legal advice .,127344013
"I ended up staying here a few nights as I couldn ' t get a room at my normal hotel , and friends were staying just around the corner .",118840411
I think I paid about $ 35aud for a room and would not pay the $ 60 that other reviewers had got charged .,118840411
"The grounds are really lovely actually , but the rooms are more than a bit tired .",118840411
The mothballs - oh my gosh ! Hidden in every nook and cranny in the room and gave me a headache .,118840411
I ended up finding them all and putting them outside .,118840411
"Staff were polite , but not friendly - very unlike the balinese at every other place I have stayed .",118840411
With a refurb and a course on smiling at guests this could be a really good spot .,118840411
I stayed at this hotel in october 2010 .,118485329
"Worst experience ever ! ! ! The room was dirty and old , there was a big hole in the door .",118485329
"There were big dead bugs in the bathroom , even cockroaches .",118485329
I definitely do not recommend this hotel ! ! .,118485329
I wanted a hotel close to the airport as I was flying out at 4 am the following morning .,69159607
The hotel was close ( 6500 rupiah for the taxi from the airport ) but the room was the worst I ' ve ever had in Bali ( 19 trips since 1981 ) .,69159607
What really annoyed me though was the very poor service .,69159607
"Apart from the staff being rude and unfriendly , I asked them when I checked in if they would ring for a taxi for me at 4am when I checked out .",69159607
' No problem sir ' .,69159607
"When I checked out I was immediately told the taxis were all busy , but they would take me to the airport for 50 000 rupiah .",69159607
I then walked 50 mtrs down the road and found 4 taxis parked there .,69159607
Next time I will stay elsewhere .,69159607
Be careful staying here : the streets around this hotel are most definitely not safe at night .,54976396
Do NOT let your children go out of the hotel compound after dark .,54976396
Beware of motorbike bandits in the area .,54976396
Otherwise this hotel is a case of ' you get what you pay for ' : mediocrity .,54976396
It ' s close to the airport but too far from the more interesting parts of Bali .,54976396
"Great ! Good air con , clean rooms serviced daily , ample power points and friendly staff .",50018524
Simple but adequate breakfast in the resturant overlooking the spacious swimming pool .,50018524
"Location - quiet but close to beach , cafes and shops .",50018524
Only Indonesian TV but it didn ' t matter .,50018524
No mini bar or ice tray - that ' s ok .,50018524
Towels - variable from fluffy to thin but always available .,50018524
If you are fussy about soft pillows - take your own .,50018524
We shall return .,50018524
"I was expecting the worse , being as cheap as this hotel was , we normaly stay at more expencive hotels , but this trip we were staying a month , so needed cheaper .",43514855
"I have to admid i LOVE this hotel , we had a clean room , the aircon worked fine , there is only one english chanel on tv , but we dont watch tv whilst on holidays , the bathroom was clean , and the staff impecable to say the least .",43514855
"The pool area does need some work , but for the price it was fantastic , the resturant meals were cheap and a great range of meals were available .",43514855
"I love the location , not in the hussle and bussle of Kuta but within 5000Rp taxi ride to the centre of Kuta ( equivelent to around 70c ) The hotel is located in a small street , where the locals are more than happy to help out and become aquainted without .",43514855
Stayed here for 4 nights ; two rooms with children .,693014668
"Very cheap accommodation , around $ 40 per room per night with breakfast Pros : - The location of the hotel is very good , rooms are fairly clean and staff very friendly .",693014668
"- Buffet breakfast was good for $ 4 - 5 per person , with younger children free .",693014668
Best recommendation is to ask for the fresh eggs / omelettes .,693014668
- Good warungs nearby ( opposite Lippo Mall ) - Ground floor rooms are quiet and good for sleeping .,693014668
Cons : - Rooms are excessively noisy unless you get a ground floor room .,693014668
"Constant traffic noise , building / construction and very loud air conditioners ( had to move rooms 3 times due to this ) - TVs in rooms would randomly lose reception - Air conditioners were not reliable , often not working early in the morning - Pool needs some .",693014668
"Location is great but it is a Bradley run down hotel Started to rain and within a hour mould appeared on the walks of the room , you could brush the spores of with your hand .",666128702
Moved to another room and it was infested with ants that crawled through the bed .,666128702
"Bed linen was filthy with hair on the sheets , I don ’ t believe sheets were changed from the last occupants .",666128702
"Pathways just a patchwork of uneven concrete , pool has chipped and broken tiles , lighting very dim walking through complex at night .",666128702
More like a backpackers than a hotel .,666128702
All I can say is it is a dump and to avoid it .,666128702
We stayed for 10 nights - 6 of us travelling .,624327518
The rooms are basic and the bathrooms could do with remodelling - but you travel to another country to see things so you are not in the room much .,624327518
Bed was hard which I like .,624327518
Staff were absolutely wonderful - beautiful people .,624327518
Breakfast was good I only ever had eggs and fruit anyway .,624327518
"Everything else we ordered in the way of food was yum and a really good price , location is good and leather shop across the road will make what ever you want but don ’ t forget to barter because they will overcharge if you let them .",624327518
"We used this hotel as we had a late flight , pretty cheap at $ 40 but also very basic and one step up from a hostel as you would expect for the price .",621524189
"Positives are that it is in a great location almost attached to Lippo Mall and a 5 - 10min walk to Discovery Mall and Waterbom , old tired room and the pool gave my family a nasty rash .",621524189
Fourth time we have stayed here since 1995 .,581289845
Inexpensive .,581289845
Quiet apart from noise from next door mall .,581289845
Staff fantastic .,581289845
Breakfast great - only 50k if you did not purchase it in your accommodation .,581289845
Pool bar nice .,581289845
Stayed here with family for 3 days .,562200271
We arrived at around 2 am .,562200271
Just few minutes away ( no more than 10 - 15 minutes by taxi - so you should pick the ' right ' ride from airport - avoid the taxi scams ! - we - family of 3 - paid 100K fro taxi ride which we thought was reasonable given that it was 2 AM and it was raining like crazy - hey you gotta help the local bali economy rolling ! ) from Denpasar airport .,562200271
Was met by reception staff after getting soaked under the rain and shoes wet ( due to flood just outside and even inside the grounds of the hotel ) .,562200271
We were given a nice room although a bit far / back side of the hotel away from the pool and restaurant .,562200271
We requested to be transferred to another room .,562200271
Make sure you book or request a room in ground floor with balcony facing the gardens .,562200271
We arrived late one evening ( around 6pm ) without a booking to enquire about room availability .,551890835
"We were told by Reception , yes , they had several room types available and the best rate could be found on Agoda , rather than booking with them direct ( which seemed very weird , but .",551890835
err .,551890835
ok ) .,551890835
"So we used Agoda on our phone in their reception to book a ' Deluxe Room with Extra Bed "" including Breakfast for 3 people .",551890835
"We showed them our booking confirmation and they agreed , but showed us a room which didn ' t remotely matched the booking we ' d made .",551890835
"They said if we want the room we booked , we have to pay more .",551890835
We inspected several room options - all uninviting .,551890835
"No matter what discussions we had subsequently , nothing made sense .",551890835
They seemed to have a poor attitude and were a bit dismissive .,551890835
"We stayed 3 weeks in this hotel , some staff are nice , some not , as usual .",544628325
They cleaned the rooms everyday and changed the towels too .,544628325
The breakfast is almost the same everyday and the chicken is mostly flour or corn starch which I find it unhealthy .,544628325
Arrived early hours in the morning took us an hour to been shown where our room was .,540355254
"Up 3 flights of stairs , which I am unable to walk up and down .",540355254
Got taken to ground floor room .,540355254
Shock was my reaction .,540355254
No tea or coffee makings .,540355254
"Bathroom Well no shower curtain no soap holders no place for shampoo , use the toilet to hold these things .",540355254
Just a basin no benches for toiletries .,540355254
Breakfast was average .,540355254
Pool area is one level sink or swim lol .,540355254
Pool floor tiles lifting All in all not happy with the hotel .,540355254
"We checked in from the 10th through to the 20th September , we were 2 families with children and had emailed the hotel for connecting rooms ( hotel replied and said they would arrange that ) Arrived and our rooms were in different blocks : ( so they expected our children to sleep the other end of the hotel from us .",527131040
( after words with them the next day they moved us closer but not next to each other .,527131040
Its not a bad hotel for the price but needs some work .,527131040
"The Bathrooms are run down and a rather weird setup , rooms were cleaned daily and restaurant food was really good .",527131040
My eldest Daughter fell in love with the resident cats : ) The staff were Great very helpful and friendly .,527131040
"The location was Great not far from the beach , Shopping etc and Lippo Mall right next door .",527131040
Breakfast was very basic .,527131040
"This hotel should have been a little gem , its staff were lovely , the gardens ware lovely and the location was ideal but the negatives far out weighed the positives .",525038854
"* There were many mangy looking cats in the dinning area , ( we saw up to 5 at a time ) rubbing up against people wanting food .",525038854
"One cat jumped on a table , I found this utterly disgusting and we NEVER ate there again .",525038854
* The milk tastes off .,525038854
"* There is NO BACON for breakfast , breakfast on offer is very basic , we found The Grill across from Lippomall was good or if you don ' t mind a small walk head to Febris Hotel their breakfast is amazing .",525038854
Or little café Gala Mor just out side .,525038854
* The water in the shower always ran hot and cold and the bathroom was in need of a bloody good clean .,525038854
( Mould in the corners ) * The power .,525038854
We arrived just before midday & received our customary drink .,510343720
Great welcome from the staff .,510343720
We had to change our room as there was an adjoining door & we could see through to next door .,510343720
The breakfast menu was no different to 4years ago & not enjoyable at all .,510343720
Some of the staff were quite rude to some visitors & were given a reprimand by them .,510343720
Kuta itself has gone downhill a lot .,510343720
"Visitors , including ourselves , are being ripped off by money changers who are living off money stolen during the counting exchange process , so travellers be alert or go to one of the banks located all over Kuta .",510343720
We found the whole time there disappointing with changes made in the shopping centers to high priced goods no cheaper than in Aussie & the attitude of the people changed so much this will be our .,510343720
Stayed here a couple of times and found it basic but clean .,509702276
I have been in a renovated room both times .,509702276
Older rooms are still getting done but okay .,509702276
Pool was clean but no cocktails there .,509702276
All the grog bottles seem to be for show only .,509702276
Food was good and not expensive .,509702276
Breakfast buffet included with the room was not a bad selection each day as well .,509702276
"Good central location and close to beach , airport , shops Lippo Mall right next door as well .",509702276
I would stay here again .,509702276
Nice pool - probably the only nice thing at this hotel .,509326663
all the rest about this hotel is terrible .,509326663
Rooms are ugly and uncomfortable and we were staying in a superior room .,509326663
In - room toilets ugly and uncomfortable .,509326663
Breakfast was not impressive either .,509326663
I had booked into Bakungs for 7 nights through Bookingdotcom .,501828042
On day of arrival I was told my room would not be ready until until 5pm .,501828042
I was with two friends who were also checking in and their rooms were ready .,501828042
When we asked why my room was not ready we were told that there were still people in my room who wernt leaving until 5pm .,501828042
"OK , not a great start as check in is at 2pm .",501828042
They did say they could provide me with a room with 2 single beds but I declined this as I had booked a double bed room and it had been confirmed .,501828042
ok .,501828042
I will put my bags into my friends room until 5pm and then come back to check in .,501828042
I needed a late check out on leaving and asked if there was any chance as my room was ready could we negotiate a late check out with no extra charge .,501828042
I thought this was fair .,501828042
The resort is located ten - fifteen minutes walking from the airport in Denpasar .,495611148
The beach is also very cose and on the main road there are a lot od restaurants and clubs where you can spend your leisure time and having lunch and dinner .,495611148
Inside the hotel there is a nice small swimming pool and all around beautiful greenery .,495611148
The place is quiet .,495611148
Personnel is kind but not professional .,495611148
"The service is minimal , some plates could scare you , for example "" Margarita pizza "" with ketchup instead of italian passata , anyway the prices of the restaurant such as hotel ' s ones are very low , you can have a dinner for two for 10 dollars .",495611148
The WiFi is in all the building but sometimes the connection is instable .,495611148
"Recap , honest price to enjoy Bali without eccesso pretensions .",495611148
Was booked into this hotel for three nights .,487800339
On arriving late ( 1 .,487800339
30am ) after plane was delayed there was no one at reception .,487800339
Waited a good 20 mins til someone finally came .,487800339
Was given a room way down the back and up many flights of stairs .,487800339
First impression of the room was OMG .,487800339
it was nothing like the pictures .,487800339
it was terrible .,487800339
very small room .,487800339
bugs .,487800339
aircon didnt work .,487800339
fridge not cold .,487800339
bed squeaky and uncomfortable .,487800339
Asked to be moved and was moved to a bigger room and more stairs .,487800339
Bed was the same .,487800339
aircon still didnt work and door didnt lock .,487800339
Didnt get much sleep and next morning checked out and moved to another hotel .,487800339
I didnt really care about losing the money I had paid .,487800339
just wanted to get out of their .,487800339
False advertising as their rooms are nothing like .,487800339
Sorry to say this place was a very poor standard .,484045580
"We arrived to wait for our rooms , bottom floor near the pool which we thought looking from the outside would be ok .",484045580
Entering the rooms they reeked of cigarettes smell .,484045580
"Now anyone that doesn ' t smoke knows the smells not going to leave by using a deodorisers to mask the smell , which the staff truely believed it would .",484045580
Also the fridge was not cleaned which turned me off .,484045580
The Aircon barely worked in the rooms which made it a no brainier to leave .,484045580
Our friends felt from the start driving into the place this place was already not looking like the photos .,484045580
They did attempt to move us to the new rooms down the back which were twice as small with the same aircon problem .,484045580
Some families just can ' t up and leave like we did so be warned the .,484045580
"As the title of this review says , you get what you pay for at Bakung Beach .",469745566
"Be certain , this is NOT a luxury hotel , it is for travelers on a budget who want to spend their money on things other than their accommodation .",469745566
It ' s position is great midway between Jalan Kartika and the beach just 5 minutes from the airport .,469745566
"Rooms are passable , air conditioned but the pool is great with a wet bar .",469745566
I and my friends always stay here for a couple of days either side of a surfing trip to Java and it does the trick as it ' s cheap and cheerful but I would NOT bring my wife & kids on a family holiday as it ' s just too basic .,469745566
This hotel was really cheap at $ 30 AU a night for 2 .,469737928
"Based on this it is a bargain and i would recommend ! Mostly clean , bathroom was a bit moldy but other than that all in the room was great .",469737928
"The pool needs maintenance , there are broken tiles with many sharp edges and the chlorine is SO strong that it burns your eyes and you cannot stay in the pool for longer than about 10 minutes due to the effects on your skin .",469737928
( Due to this I would not recommend it for little children ) Not a hotel if all you want to do is laze by the pool all day but perfect if you want to drop your bags and explore or shop and just come back to sleep .,469737928
There are couple of great really cheap places to eat in the same little lane also .,469737928
The juice bar 2 shops down towards the beach is a WINNER .,469737928
We stay in this hotel 2 nights .,468427364
"The staff was very nice 👍 🏻 , the swimming pool it ' s amazing 😉 and the food very good .",468427364
But our room was smelling bad and the bathroom was not the best one .,468427364
The room are serviced every day .,468427364
I still recommandes this hotel because is not so expensive and the staff are perfect .,468427364
"After landing in Kuta we were looking for something close to the airport , and that is about all this place has .",449463370
"The breakfast is not that great , probably best to get something on the street or in the mall 5m walk .",449463370
"Rooms are clean , but keep the A / C on to avoid mosquitos : P .",449463370
This was the worst hotel we stayed at during our trip .,440242532
"The only positive was the pool and possibly being next to Lippo plaza which also meant construction work , I ' m not talking about 9 - 5 construction either , I mean 3am chainsaws and hammer drills every .",440242532
single .,440242532
night .,440242532
"Also , if you want a towel for the shower then you ' ll be holding your breath .",440242532
They take them when they clean your room and apparently bring them back at 5pm but most nights we had to call up around 9pm to get them to bring us some .,440242532
"Also , bad luck if you wanted to take your towel down to the pool as that ensured you wouldn ' t get a fresh one that day .",440242532
Severe amount of mould in the bathroom too .,440242532
Would not stay again .,440242532
"Its a budgeted resort with swimming pool , within walking distance from Kuta beach and Lipoto mall .",436490995
Housekeeping team is good .,436490995
Property is going through some renovation .,436490995
AC in room is old and my remote didn ' t function well in last two days .,436490995
Better not to switch it off at all .,436490995
Complimentary breakfast is wholesome and Advisable to carry your own bedsheet .,436490995
"All in all , good value for money , location is great .",436490995
Currently at the pool doing this review .,421666154
For $ 30 per night .,421666154
Bargain ! ! .,421666154
I will be back here that ' s for sure .,421666154
Decent size pool and nice staff .,421666154
Room was clean also .,421666154
I haven ' t found an issue at all .,421666154
We booked the hotel for 3 weeks .,400245105
It was 3 weeks of horror .,400245105
Breakfast is minimum .,400245105
"Your chooses are toast ( guarded and need to be ordered ) strawberry jam or pineapple , 1 egg per person per day , Cold Balinese food .",400245105
Watermelon and mango .,400245105
"Coffee , tea , orange juice .",400245105
That ' s it .,400245105
I was chocked ! We had booked a room for 3 .,400245105
My daughters bed was later installed .,400245105
"2 mattresses where put on the floor , and that was her bed .",400245105
The sheets On the bedding was torn 9 out of 10 times .,400245105
We only got 2 towels a day in the first week .,400245105
I guess they didn ' t see it was a 3 persons room with the 3 beds .,400245105
The phones in the room don ' t work at all .,400245105
So in case of emergency you ' ll have to run up to reception for help .,400245105
There where rats running around because the hotel had there own carnage storage .,400245105
""" That ' s Bali "" .",400245105
"Nice and clean , air conditioned , cold fridge , friendly staff , spacious .",399009358
Everything that you really need .,399009358
We only stayed one night which was fine .,399009358
We have been spoilt by the big resorts so we would not stay here for several days .,399009358
Basic but good .,399009358
This is my 3rd stay at Bakung Beach and definitely my last .,378887527
"Whilst you cannot complain about the price and location close to airport , the place really needs a little tender love and care .",378887527
The rooms are big with comfortable bed .,378887527
"Shower area would fit 6 people but don ' t expect hot water , it is pretty hit or miss .",378887527
"Besides the flat TV , the furniture is outdated and should be consigned to the tip .",378887527
"The air conditioner works , however , I had difficulty sleeping from the vibrating notice of an adjoining room AC .",378887527
Breki is very basic to the extent they ration you to 1 egg only .,378887527
If you really want a good breakfast then walk next door to 5 star hotel and pay $ 15 .,378887527
My main gripe with this hotel is the swimming pool .,378887527
"It ' s too deep , stinks of chlorine and the tiles walls and surrounds are green .",378887527
Lovely oasis between the busy streets of Kuta .,359207316
"Nice breakfast , swimming pool and relaxing area and wifi at the pool is not bad .",359207316
No wifi available in the rooms and there are not enough beds at the pool to relax during the day .,359207316
Rooms are simple but clean and with good airco .,359207316
Never would advise anyone on this Hotel .,356693973
Linen very tired and grubby looking .,356693973
"No kettle or cups , coffee , tea facilities .",356693973
"Shower wet everything in the bathroom , keep lid down on toilet .",356693973
Breakfast was very poor and uninteresting .,356693973
Food was not covered and flies walking on the food .,356693973
Wouldn ' t even think of eating at restaurant .,356693973
Staff didn ' t seem very helpful .,356693973
When we were there hotel frequented with more europeans than westerners .,356693973
I know it was low priced and I have learnt my lesson .,356693973
But still would say no at anyone thinking of staying here .,356693973
2nd stay here in the past year and not much has changed .,326172495
If you ' re on a budget this hotel is classic Bali .,326172495
"In a great location , friendly staff and adequate large rooms .",326172495
"Linen is old , towels cleaned daily and breakfast range is small but plentiful .",326172495
If you ' re on a $ $ budget this is a great place to stay .,326172495
It ' s not 5 star and could do with a lot of updating but this is what the charm of Bali used to be .,326172495
We booked the 3 room deal for our family trip .,318779413
The four kids were in adjoining rooms and thoroughly enjoyed themselves .,318779413
Breakfast was included and although limited in choice was fresh and kept full each day .,318779413
The staff all seem to have worked there forever and you do get the impression your interupting them with any request through the front desk .,318779413
Pool area was great but over chlorinated .,318779413
Probably wouldn ' t book it again but budget wise couldn ' t fault the place .,318779413
We were the only guests arriving that time .,310898974
The staff ignored us by their conversation continuing together .,310898974
"After that no welcome just "" what do you want "" I replied I booked 2 rooms .",310898974
"Asked for floor room , our room was available 7pm ( checked in around 2 o ' clock ) We were given 202 and 305 .",310898974
"The staff who carried our suite cases upstairs were waiting for a "" tip "" , informed them we will give some money tomorrow morning .",310898974
I know we always do tip this time we very very upset by the reception .,310898974
They keep waiting .,310898974
I know they do a good job gave them 100 .,310898974
000 Rp the next day .,310898974
The room was great and the breakfast great .,310898974
Our flight came in the middle of the night so we decided to stay somewhere nearby for our first few days in Bali .,305795132
"The price to stay here is fair , the grounds are beautiful , there is a nice swimming pool , and the room we had was downstairs in the corner but still quite nice .",305795132

Large and very deep pool .,298476491
Sometimes a little bit over chlorinated but very clean .,298476491
Where the hotel is located is in a quiet lane so very quiet at night .,298476491
Only a 10 minute walk to Kutas main shops and beach .,298476491
The hotel has a new shopping centre ( lippo mall ) at the end of the lane with a supermarket which has everything you could need .,298476491
Already planning my next trip and will definitely stay there again .,298476491
From the moment we arrived we knew we were on a winner .,294579489

I feel some reveiws very crictical .,277990684
You have to realise this a budget hotel if you want luxury and a massive buffet breakfast go pay $ 300 a night somewhere else .,277990684
Rooms were large clean and had comfy beds Breakfast cost about $ 2 a day when pre booked am \ nd is ample and if you ask they will cook bacon and eggs or omlette just ask its free just not in buffet .,277990684
meals are cheap and tasty but range is limited .,277990684
Large Bintangs 35000 rupiah ( 150000 at the $ 300 a night hotel ) Boat to go surf kuta reef etc 200m walk Supermarket and Lippo mall 200m walk taxi to Kuta $ 1 Best value in Bali .,277990684

"Fried noodles and fried chicken or fried rice every morning , you will need to order bacon or eggs from the kitchen as they do not have it on the buffet .",268192369
The hotel is right next door to Lippo Mall .,268192369
The rooms are not that big or spacious .,268192369

"Rice , noodles , sausages in sauces , we even had battered fish .",205598735
"I would never stay here again : 1 ) There is no pool ( being rebuilt until July ) 2 ) The front desk is very rude and charged me 20 , 000idr to CALL a taxi .",201973091
"3 ) The doors between neighboring rooms are thin slats with large gaps so you can see into other peoples rooms ! ! ! ( Very creepy ) 4 ) Because of the thin doors and walls you can hear everything in the adjacent rooms , that means at 0500 we were woken by the family next to us talking and packing , literally we could hear every word they were saying .",201973091
"5 ) It is expensive for this area of Kuta , we had much better rooms for 175000idr 6 ) The bathroom is terrible .",201973091

"Stay elsewhere , big dissapointment .",201973091
Room was spartan to say the least .,183584869

The blankets were very old and scratchy .,183584869

The photos on the website looked reasonable so we were happy to book it in .,183135102
We arrived at about 1am in the morning and went really greeted at all .,183135102
We were shown to our room where nothing was explained and then the person left telling us we needed to take the voucher down for breakfast between 7 and 10am .,183135102
The room next to us has their TV up to ridiculous levels and as the walls were paper thin there was no chance of us getting to sleep .,183135102
They finally returned at about 3am but continued to make plenty of noise and they were then joined in the room by at least 3 other people partying on until at least 4am .,183135102

It gives me more than i expect .,181321664

Me and my partner have stayed her twice within the last 2 months .,179872006
We are traveling around Asia and had two good last minute deals with this hotel .,179872006
"Our room was very spacious , but basic , everything we needed though , aircon and hot water .",179872006
"The breakfast is quite basic , the pool is nice but needs some maintenance ( cracked tiles everywhere and the level of chlorine into he swimming pool is very high , so watch your eyes ) .",179872006
The staff were very friendly and polite and helped us when we asked .,179872006
There isa .,179872006
"Brilliant hypermarket just opened next to the hotel , it is amazing .",179872006
"As the breakfast was very basic , we decided to buy our own toast toppings , which was very cheap and made the breakfast better .",179872006
We found the place to be a good base close to the airport due to the very early hour arrival time at Dempasar Airport .,178230231
We were booked for 5 nights at the hotel .,178230231
Staff and the security guard were on hand for a speedy room and luggage check in before we were off again on a 3 hour drive to another dive resort leaving excess baggage behind .,178230231
"The room with bathroom clean and spacious was on d ground floor , which made it convenient for us .",178230231
Breakfast offered with d room was adequate but I found the taste of water required getting used to as it tasted like ORS .,178230231
Better to have yr own mineral water supply .,178230231
The hotel is well known as own arrangements for tours and outings was a breeze and pick up was on the dot .,178230231
Lots of activities in d surrounding area including d beach was within .,178230231
Stayed at this very poor excuse of a hotel from August 22 to 27 2013 .,176982732
The room was basic and average .,176982732
fairly clean but the linen was gross .,176982732
Breakfast was not fit for human consumption as far as I ' m concerned and looked disgusting .,176982732
The staff were nice though except for one annoying bar person at the pool bar that kept harassing me to get tattoos from his brother .,176982732
Do yourself a favour and spend and extra few bucks and stay somewhere else .,176982732
"I stayed here in November 2011 , the bar and restaurant is excellent , excellent pool .",166118244
For the money these rooms cost you can ' t complain .,166118244
"It ' s what you ' d expect for the money , don ' t pay anymore than AU $ 35 a night with breakfast , i think you could barter them down a little more .",166118244
"Apparently they have refurbished rooms now , would like to try them out ! Only downfall is the location , too far too easily walk into the main entertainment district , you ' ll end up spending lots of money on taxis .",166118244
"Although taxis are cheap as chips in Bali , it still adds up .",166118244
"Am going back to Bali in August 2013 and was very tempted to stay at Bakung ' s again , but trying somewhere closer to my favourite area , Legian Rd / Poppies Lane 1 & 2 .",166118244
There is a guy out the front that must have some kind of deal going with .,166118244

Our family loves it - were here 3 years ago and glad we came back ! .,165654112
Had stayed at Bakung Beach for the last 10 years have just arrived to find that all the rooms have been updated with free wifi which works fantastic little bit of noise from the new shopping centre next door being built but for $ 30 a night one of the best places to stay in Tuban .,161845077
Also new TV ' s all with satellite TV .,161845077
the facade looks great with the reception area that will make your expectations higher with the rooms you ' ll get but only disappointing you .,151541801
the first room given to us was not even made up yet so we had to transfer to another room .,151541801
this time its made up but the AC was not working well ( not cold ) .,151541801
even saw some junk ACs stocked at one quarter .,151541801

Yes the the linen is not upto any standeds .,151347492

But it didn ' t bother us .,151347492
"Recently stayed here and found the hotel , staff and location very nice and suitable .",136254996
Loved walking down the lane and through Pantai Restaurant to the beach .,136254996
Then taking a 10min stroll along the beach to Discovery Mall .,136254996
Everything at my fingertips .,136254996

The location is not bad .,53615613
I love the area in Tuban as it is away from the noise of Kuta .,53615613
The hotel is walking distance to the Waterbom park & the Discovery Mall & lots of nice restaurants .,53615613
The pool area is kept up quite well .,53615613
"The problem was the room , it was old & in disrepair .",53615613
They had about 6 mothballs over the drain in the bathroom & the whole room smelled like mothballs .,53615613
I dreaded coming back to the room each night because of the smell .,53615613
"It is tempting to want to stay here because of the location & the low price , but I wish I would have paid more & stayed elsewhere .",53615613
We didnt expect a flash hotel but we did not expect anything as discusting as this ! ! We had to ask 3 times to get some towels to our room the first day we were there .,35996426
We went down to the pool to have lunch and nearly got attached by a feral cat ! ! the pool bar doesnt even work and looks like it hasnt been up and going in agers the pool tiles were all coming off the bottom over the stay of 3 days we noticed about 3 people getting out the pool with cut feet .,35996426
I would not eat at the restaurant as there was cats in the kitchen which meant we lost out on the breakfast each morning ! ! We had to change rooms the first day as the shower wasnt working neither was the aircon .,35996426
the second room was better apart from the leaking ariconditioner and damp smell .,35996426
We ended up moving hotels as it .,35996426
"Booked 2 rooms , one double 104 and one twin 109 , on entry we knew straight away the place was smelly the shower didn ' t have z bends and the sheets although wash were so washed out the still had massive stains on the sheets .",30701612
"We requested another room for the double as the inital room 104 was tiny we were reallocated room 704 this was higher up and therefore managed to escape some but not all the mossies , ( I stay in Thailand so I know about mossies ) There was no Englsih TV stations at all the sheets were still washed out .",30701612
After the first night we got a telephone call in the morning offering us special deal the caller knew my name even though I had changed rooms .,30701612
Spoke with the Manager and informed him that his staff were giving out my details to touts he only seemed to .,30701612

"not sure why ? I seemed to have a tv remote that worked when I arrived , but not the next day .",712505599
I suspected the batteries and did bring it to the notice of reception who said they ' d send someone but never did .,712505599
Thank goodness for Youtube and books .,712505599
The grounds of the hotel are quite lovely and the pool looked very attractive .,712505599
One of the greatest things is the hotels proximity to Lippo Mall and its collection of shops and some nice eateries .,712505599
"Also , the .",712505599
"We haven ' t stayed at Bakung Beach Resort , but are eagerly wanting to stay soon .",706151171

"Cheapish hotel in great location if you want to be near airport , lippo mall and the beach .",684471197
Nice pool and garden area if you like the old style hotel .,684471197
"However it is run down , For a night or twos stay may be OK but we stayed for 7 nights and the bed was uncomfortable , sheets were dirty and smelly so was the pillow , they really do need to buy new bedding .",684471197
The cleaners were friendly but I didn ' t think breakfast was worth it and the staff weren ' t that friendly at all .,684471197
The air con made a hideous noise and was just so / so in cooling ability .,684471197
"Fridge worked , toilet flushed sort of , lid broken , shower worked but yes as for most hotels that age and price there is mould in the shower which faces the toilet .",684471197
Balcony was nice and the hotel itself was quite I thought until dogs start barking .,684471197
I was initially put into room 710 .,673476860
The cleanliness of it was actually fine however the air con and fridge did not work .,673476860
A maintenance guy came up to check everything and then left without doing anything .,673476860
I called reception back and requested a new room .,673476860
"Although the manager didn ' t seem to thrilled about it , I was then moved to room 605 which was far superior .",673476860
It looked like it had been renovated more recently .,673476860
"The room was spacious , comfy bed , clean linen , private balcony and the bathroom didn ' t have any mould .",673476860
"Check - in was very meh , I didn ' t really feel welcome at all and no one helped me with my luggage up three flights of stairs .",673476860
"The breakfast was very average , luke warm ' hot food ' with little variety .",673476860
The gardens and pool look lovely but i didn ' t have time for a swim .,673476860
I .,673476860

I truly loved my stay at Bakung Beach Resort and it was more than perfect to me .,669958751
The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful .,669958751
It felt like home .,669958751
What a crap place .,669648489
Buggered up our rooms .,669648489
Smelt of sewage until we were moved .,669648489
Food was disgusting .,669648489
No service and it looked like it needed a bloody good clean up .,669648489
Definitely a place not stay at .,669648489

Courtyard full of green and there is even a swimming pool .,635037169
Okay not super luxury all but still good .,635037169
Good girl for the price you pay .,635037169
from now one I will start and finish here my vacations .,635037169
"Positives : Beds , AC .",633372594
"( Maybe got the lucky room in that regard ) Negatives : staff seemed to not care that much for the guests , didnt even show us to the room or help us carry out bags Only a tired lady in the reception and we arrived around 6pm .",633372594
They did not maintain the hotel at all .,633372594
"It was very run down , rooms were probably pretty nice a couple of years ago .",633372594
The bathroom was awful .,633372594
Moldy drapes and water on the floor did not fall to the drain so it was constanly wet and smelled bad .,633372594

Good localisation just next to the beach .,586897331
"If you need a place for chilling in bali , I advise you this hotel .",586897331
By far the worst and filtiest hotel i ’ ve ever booked .,565250884
"Fungus and mold on the ceiling and wall , teared up sheets and towels , shower with icecold or bloodyhot water no inbetween , with no consistent flow , like somebody is pumping the water .",565250884
"Even when you dont pay much for the rooms , the least you can expect is clean rooms and clean sheets ( after a week they still didnt renewed them , i could tell by the stains , tears and smell ) .",565250884
"The worst thing of all , while we were out for an hour to lunch after we complained , they quickly painted over the mold on the ceiling ! ! See pic 2 and 8 .",565250884
"Though the manager was friendly and apologised , this hotel gave us the creeps .",565250884

It was our last two nights in Bali and we have choose to stay at the Bakung Beach hotel .,506099272
The ambience was good with the great pool .,506099272
Even Beach was few minutes walking distance form the hotel .,506099272
Those who wants to be close to the beach can book this resort .,506099272
I was there for 3 nights and i love the location as it near with many attractions place .,467123462
Food was ok woth affordable price .,467123462
"Unfortunately , the air conditioning was leaking .",467123462
I informed the receptionist but he told me to put the towel underneath the air - cond .,467123462
They didn ' t rectify it until we check out .,467123462
"The wifi was super poor , we were not able to connect wifi from our room .",467123462

Sad breakfast .,458419269
One of the worst hotels I have visited .,440243057
You can make the assumption for the money not to expect much but it was horrific .,440243057
"Poor cleanliness , poor staff and poor location with the construction going on 24 / 7 .",440243057
Located close to the airport and the bustling streets of Kuta .,426023116
"The street leading from the Kartika Plaza mall to the hotel is pedestrians only , so your cab may have a difficult time finding the access road ( on the beach side ) .",426023116

"Wifi coverage is not extensive ( just in the cafe / pool area , not in my room ) .",426023116

"We have stayed at Bakungs 5 times , always as a 3 day stop over on our way to and from Java .",423382034
It is basic .,423382034
"very basic but for the price , it ' s well worth a look .",423382034
"2 minutes walk to the beach and right at the airport end of the main road from Semenyak to Kuta , it has a great position .",423382034
"When it ' s time to leave , the airport is only 5 minutes away so there ' s no stressing you ' ll be late for your flight .",423382034
"We checked in for our stay , and straight away knew we were in for a crappy time ! Couldn ' t find our reservation , then didn ' t give us rooms together as requested , as we were travelling with teenagers .",416051387
"When we asked if we could have rooms together as requested in email , the lady at the front rudely told us we were lucky enough to get ground floor ! Got shown to our rooms , 1 was newly refurbished but air con didn ' t work properly and was in a dark corner with noisy renovations going on beside it .",416051387
"The second room , was in a dark corner at the other end , with a view from our terrace of old , broken wooden chairs and rubbish , and the sound of tiles being sawn beside us .",416051387
"Inside the room was mouldy , and the musty smell was making me choke ! Could hardly breathe ! Tv didn ' t work , mould up the .",416051387
My 4 week August 2016 stay at Bakung Beach Hotel was our second stay from our 2015 stay .,415518511
The staff continue to be friendly helpful and happy .,415518511
The accomodation and breakfast continue to be reasonable value but please guys fix fix fix the murky green pool water .,415518511
On most days of that 4 weeks 2016 stay you could not see the bottom of the pool it was so murky .,415518511
The water was also stinging mine and other guests eyes similar to our previous stay but at least then the water was clear .,415518511
This was pointed out to the front desk staff on a number of occaisions .,415518511
The water should be the normal clear ' blue ' color of any normal healthy pool .,415518511
There were the standard number of guest on the pool sunlounges but very few swimming this time .,415518511
The pool area and water quality are ( very obviously ) one of .,415518511
I was a little disappointed visiting Bakung again .,412963629
Whilst this is not a top hotel it has gone down hill since last time I visited .,412963629
The good points was the clean linen and comfy bed and of course the price .,412963629
On the negative side the breakfast was not as good as last time with quite a limited choice especially with fruit .,412963629
The biggest disappointment was the state of the pool .,412963629
It was the same colour as the diving pool in Rio .,412963629
green .,412963629
The atmosphere was quite dull with the swim up bar not operational on our stay .,412963629
Anyway for the price it is a viable choice for an overnight stay near the airport .,412963629
Stayed for 6 nights in August .,412608777
"The staff are really friendly and helpful , about a 5 minute walk to the beach which was always quiet when i was there , 2 minute walk to Lipo Mall which has a supermarket and foodhall on the ground floor which was handy .",412608777
Airport is about a 10 - 15 minute drive .,412608777
The room had lcd / plasma TV with a good selection of english channels including the Australia + channel which is good if you like AFL .,412608777
Aircon worked well .,412608777
"Big balcony , minibar , shower with hot water and good pressure , room cleaned everyday .",412608777
The only small negatives was that my room was interconnecting with the room next door so i could hear the neighbours sometimes and its about a 20 minute walk to pubs and clubs on Legian street .,412608777
I am currently staying at the hotel for a short vacation in Bali .,412510548
It ' s located very close to the airport so one may even walk from and to it .,412510548
( 2 .,412510548
5 km ) .,412510548
The pool is really nice and open till 11pm .,412510548
I also suggest getting the breakfast because it offers a good variety of dishes .,412510548
The staff is nice and helpful and the rooms are meeting the expectations .,412510548
There is wifi around the pool for people who want to work and relax at the same time .,412510548
"We went to Bakungs in July a family of four , the staff are amazing it is only a short walk to the beach there are great spas and restaurants very close to the hotel next door there is a shopping mall it has everything you need we have been going to this hotel for 10 years .",410826776
"Spent 1 night here , not out of choice .",409917693
"Arrived at midnight , supposed to be picked up by the hotel .",409917693
But when I arrived NO ONE WAS THERE TO PICK ME UP and I had no where else to go .,409917693
"Floors were sticky , door had a big gap between the door and the wall .",409917693
The bathroom felt mouldy and yuck .,409917693
Did not even use it .,409917693
No in room dining .,409917693
Aircon was a hit and miss .,409917693
"The room had no internet , I had to be right beside the pool to use the Internet .",409917693
Worst part was there was no safe in the room .,409917693
Hated every second here and would never go back .,409917693
This was my 2nd stay here .,405943768
Spacious rooms friendly staff nice pool .,405943768
I like the area .,405943768
So close to LippoMall .,405943768
Omelets at breakfast are really good .,405943768
We had 4 nights .,405943768
Very happy .,405943768
They have cable TV air conditioning works well .,405943768
Room serviced daily water each day .,405943768
This place sucked hard .,400645716
"room was terrible , shower sprays everwhere and as another review stated goes from boiling hot to freezing cold constantly , staff were non existant , pool bar not staffed , breakfast ordinary , nothing going on at the end of the beach its located beers were a full 1 / 3 more expensive then the place we ussually stay we ended up checking out after 2 nights even though we booked 5 .",400645716
"honestly if your looking for something in this price range try la walon in poppies lane , cheap , clean , great friendly staff always regret having to go home when we stay there .",400645716
The entrance to the reception is a bit different : you have to take two stairs to do this .,382843184
But the people are friendly an helpful in many ways .,382843184
The room we had was large and clean .,382843184
"The bathroom , was allso large , but there was no space divider between the shower and toilet so nearly all of the floor was wet after a shower .",382843184
No shelf for toiletbrush and such .,382843184
Big balcony and adequate airconditioning .,382843184
"The hotel is situated 5 minutes walk from the beach , 2 minutes from the start of the buzzing main street with restaurants and 5 minutes walk from the first "" warung "" , the indonesian low profile restaurants .",382843184
It takes about 15 minutes walk to the center of Kuta .,382843184
"Right across the hotel ( and in the same street ) are different shops : 4 tattooshops , a few small restaurants , toys & clothing and .",382843184
This is my 5th and last time at Bakung .,380189440
I can put up with a shower that covers the entire bathroom floor including the toilet with water .,380189440
I can even tolerate that rude woman in the reception or that they NEVER give me the room I request .,380189440
I can even stand the pounding and noise from above .,380189440
But enough ! ! The hot water contiuously goes from scalding to cold continuously without warning .,380189440
"The bed went from two sheets to one , then two singles draped across a bare stained mattress that you end up sleeping on because the sheets are overlapped and too small .",380189440
The pool is literally green from neglect .,380189440
Looks like an ear infection waiting to happen .,380189440
Or the broken sharp tiles at stairs might cut you and do the same .,380189440
When brought to the attention of staff they smile and shrug their shoulders as .,380189440
"The price is reasonable , old style hotel , but the cleanness and hygiene of the room was unsatisfied .",375447047
"In Room ' s amenities are poor , there is no kettle nor compliment tea or coffee .",375447047
The room is quite big with a balcony .,375447047
"Give up all your expectation before going to this hotel if you have to stay there , you wont be disappointed .",375447047
"However , I wont recommend this hotel to any , even it ' s good price , we can find something better with the price .",375447047
Oh the hotel also offers very uninformative and unhelpful staffs yet they have a warm smile which calm us down anyway .,375447047
"I often come back to Bakungs beacause its cheap , clean has large rooms , cold air and a big pool .",373582848
Staff are very friendly and it has a low key feeling .,373582848
Its quiet and close to the beach .,373582848
Breakfast is eat as much as you want indo and euro nothing flash but good enough .,373582848
Endless coffee and tea .,373582848
"Walk outside to multiple restaurants massage spas and other traders straight outside the entrance , very handy .",373582848
Large modern mall ( Lippo Mall ) opened up next door with food hall and lots of shopping for the girls all a | c and quiet .,373582848
Walk outside turn left walk 4 min and your on the beach .,373582848
rooms are dirty after complaining about human was on toilet and dirt all over floor .,372218158
it appeared on the up untill the next room which also just as bad photos appear deceiving as the place i stayed at was outdated and unkept .,372218158
"along with this the 2am wakeup call from securties family members and constant banging left my first trip to bali not a good one when asked if they have a shuttle for airport drop off pick up i was told know , however from the photos they do have a business van .",372218158
"It is typical oldstyle bali accommodation , needs work but hey for $ 35 a night and i know others got it for $ 25 , for that price i would give it an extra star .",371652288
"The rooms are large , with not much else , the shower doesnt want to regulate between hot and cold .",371652288
"The pool area and swim up bar are great , although broken tiles .",371652288
"The breakfast is ok , order the omelets so good .",371652288
Its out of the way from restaurants and bars and i like to be in the activity and have choices .,371652288
Pay for what you get really .,371652288
I had a pleasant holiday at the Bakung in February 2015 for 15 days .,365890115
Unfortunately it has taken me this long to sit and pop my review in due to contracting Dengue Fever during this holiday .,365890115
I feel the water features and the area had something to do with this .,365890115
I don ' t think I would stay at a hotel which has a pond again if I ever do return to beautiful Bali .,365890115
It has been a whole year since being in paradise ! ! Anyway enough about me .,365890115
the staff here are just beautiful .,365890115
Breakfast is really enjoyable with a nice selection .,365890115
The pool is sunny most of the day and sparkling clean .,365890115
My only complaint about the pool is they need to clean more regularly around the tiles of the swim up bar as it gets a bit dirty around the water level .,365890115
Rooms are aged but lovely and clean as is the linen .,365890115
We stayed here for 3 days whilst travelling around Bali .,364504579
We booked it on booking .,364504579
com but they couldn ' t find my booking reservation nor have a room ready for us when we arrived .,364504579
"Once we got to our room it was perfect for what we needed , large room with aircon , TV , hot shower and clean room .",364504579
The next morning we went for breakfast which was only an extra £ 2 a day for the both of us we only ate in there the first day .,364504579
"There was nothing to offer , we only ate toast that morning .",364504579
"There was no cereal or egg , bacon , tomatoes , beans ect that you would expect to find in a buffet style breakfast .",364504579
"The only option was boiled rice and curry - not what we wanted at 8am ! ! The pool is beautiful , it was large , clean and went very deep - 3m I believe .",364504579
There was a pool bar in the centre .,364504579
Many .,364504579
The staff were so rude .,361731324
The room I paid for was not what I received I had a choice of twin or double booked and paid for double and taken to a twin when I pointed this out I was told to push the beds together .,361731324
The cat excrement is every were and the smell is overpowering from it around gardens and pool .,361731324
The breakfast was very poor and they were more concerned with me not presenting my breakfast voucher .,361731324
tiles in pool quite broken and sharp I ended up checking out and going elsewhere for the same price and a lot my pleasant .,361731324
There were to many incidents to mention but the worst was when one of my family were checking out and all paid up at 11 pm at night to fly home the women at reception started demanding what we were doing and wanting to know what room we were in and we .,361731324
OK Here we go if your a stuck up traveler Dont STAY HERE .,336333562
Its a BUDGET HOTEL That has great clean rooms great staff and location .,336333562
Breakfast is average but enough they cook your eggs and nice bacon for you .,336333562
Pool great gardens nice .,336333562
AIRCON Cold Linen USED But Clean .,336333562
7 minutes to airport .,336333562
NO SAFES IN ROOM you have SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES WHICH WORK GOOD .,336333562
Will use this hotel again if on a BUDGET .,336333562
Thanks to all the staff it was a great time had by all .,336333562
"Good hotel with nice buffet breakfast , airco in room nd good bed .",334514834

Friendly staff .,334514834
The pool has to much chloride in the water .,334514834
Room is abit dark but view in the garden is nice .,334514834
"The hotel is clean and has nice park , the pool is also great .",304902620
"Also its near the ngurah rai airport about 2k , if you find hard to find this hotel just go to lippo mall near the airport its not far from there .",304902620
Stayed at this hotel from 6august to 10 august .,297686579
Pool not so good too many chlorine .,297686579
Food below standard .,297686579
Staff front office very slow .,297686579
Housekeeping staff very great ! ! They always clean the room everyday .,297686579
Love it ! The place is Behind bloody lippomall Many mosquitos even you spray it the room .,297686579
But this hotel is for couples or young people not so good with family with little children .,297686579
Anyway thank you .,297686579
We stayed September 2014 with another couple and are very much looking forward to staying again September 2015 .,295880012
The staff we very friendly .,295880012
Steven the manager went out of her way to make sure we had our sunset photos before our flight home .,295880012
The location of the hotel is perfect for our needs .,295880012
"Lippo mall is right next door just down the lane is Pantai restaurant , there are loads of stalls in the lane way as well as some smaller warungs ( also very good ) .",295880012
"This hotel has a swim up bar , open air restaurant , free wifi , air con rooms and relaxing atmosphere .",295880012
"Looking forward bringing more of my family this September to meet our friends Agung , Dewai , Katut , and all the lovely ladies at the Bakung .",295880012
Stayed here from 21 to 24 July 2015 .,293166032
"For the price I paid ( around IDR 800 , 000 , - for 3 nights ) , this hotel exceed all expectations .",293166032
"Smooth check - in / check out process , friendly staffs , spacious room with balcony to boot , clean bathroom , mini fridge and water heater , and fresh towel every day .",293166032
The pool was quite nice although the chlorine ' s a tad too strong for my liking .,293166032
"We were given a room in the back , near the Lippo Mall ' s parking lot but it was quiet so we had a good night ' s sleep everynight .",293166032
"And oh , there ' s a hypermart at the basement of Lippomall , you can get basically anything you need there .",293166032
"A 100 meters walk to the west will get you to a nice , quiet beach where you can enjoy sunset .",293166032
"Upon checking out , you can get an unofficial airport transfer for IDR 50 .",293166032
"000 , - : ) Will .",293166032
The hotel itself was a disappointment .,274932870
"No phone service , and no Wifi .",274932870
The service was ok but I guess you get what you pay for .,274932870
Breakfast was very average .,274932870
I wouldn ' t stay here again .,274932870
The best I can say is that the pool was ok .,274932870
Perfect location from kuta beach and airport .,274923658
Good price .,274923658
Good facilities but not with the towel .,274923658
I checked in at 12 am and they gave the towel maybe at 6 pm .,274923658
The hotel behind the lippo mall so it will be easy to spend time for a solo traveller .,274923658
I have stayed at this hotel before mainly due to its close distance to airport .,269825412
"Bali traffic can be a nightmare and if you are at the northern end of Kuta , Legian or seminak it is impossible to say how .",269825412
Long will it take to get to the airport .,269825412
Depending on the time of day it could take 1 to 2 hours .,269825412
I have heard stories of 3 hours .,269825412
Bakung is only a short drive to the airy so you can get there quickly .,269825412
The hotel is set off the Main Street so it is reasonably quiete .,269825412
"Rooms are basic but will meet your needs , flat TV , big showere Nd comfortable bed .",269825412
Pool is too deep and over chlorinated .,269825412
Breakfast is basis but meals and cocktails very reasonably priced .,269825412
There is large shopping centre on the corner but overpriced .,269825412
You can walk to the beach front in 5 minutes and along the main Kuta .,269825412
At jl .,266732643
Samudera just 2 min walk from Lippomall and about 3 - 4 min from the beach is Bakung Beach cottages .,266732643
"It ' s clean , friendly and affordable .",266732643
There is free wifi in the hotel .,266732643
"The breakfast is ok , you can choose from fried rice or toast with egg and fruit juice , coffee .",266732643
It ' s a pity that the fruit platter is mostly each day the same papaya and watermelon .,266732643
I really enjoyed my stay here .,266732643
At the front office they have a safe .,266732643
Better to change money in Lippomall as the exchange rate there is better .,266732643
"This hotel is cheap nice and tidy good location to every where airport , shopping , beach and water boom park .",258190268
But no hair dryer and no tooth brush .,258190268
The building is not bad .,258190268
Internet was not worked in second day .,258190268
They say all Bali connection was down .,258190268
Average for every things is fair enough .,258190268
"loved our stay , walking distance from Lippomall shopping centre .",257576654
Walking distance to beach .,257576654
"Wifi was reasonable and worked most times but weather played havoc with this , not the hotels fault .",257576654
Bathroom water smelt but this is the water .,257576654
Rooms were very basic and if you are a non - smoker then we would suggest you get a non - smoking area away from smokers as this made us feel quite ill .,257576654
This again not the hotels fault and we did not complain to them .,257576654
"The bar , kitchen and cleaning staff were all awesome and reception easy to deal with .",257576654
Enjoyed our stay very much .,257576654
Thank you .,257576654
"As you were stepped in this hotel , you felt welcomed as the receptionist giving their positive gestures as they greeted you and welcomed you with their "" welcome drinks "" .",254001906
"The breakfast limited to 2 main courses dishes only , not much variety but i don ' t bother about the meals .",254001906
"The wait and waitress well organized but somehow i felt the services at restaurant were "" double standards "" as they mainly focused on "" foreign "" peoples while the others guest they didn ' t bother at all .",254001906
I didn ' t mean that all the waiter and waitress but i did recall some of them .,254001906
Too bad i cant their names as they didnt have name bagdes .,254001906
"Even though i were there for a week , but sadly they didnt recognized me and my names .",254001906
They kept asked for the breakfast coupons .,254001906
": ( But , i falling in love with your pool ! .",254001906
This hotel is cheap .,241168338
It costs me less than AUD $ 100 to stay for three nights .,241168338
It ' s nice .,241168338
I can get my own room and balcony and there is a pool in the hotel .,241168338
There was a bad smell from bathroom drain .,241168338
"I think this hotel would be great for travelers with tight budget , like me .",241168338
"But if budget wasn ' t really an issue , then stay at a little bit more expensive one would be better ! According to Hotels .",241168338
"com , they should have wifi everywhere .",241168338
But I can ' t get reception in my room or balcony .,241168338
The hotel is quite ok .,239873433
only 100m from beach but it is quite hidden .,239873433
need to ask for directions to the beach .,239873433
we got a clean and spacious room with a balcony which overlook the garden .,239873433
it came with a simple breakfast which was fine good enough .,239873433
they could improve by providing mosquito spray or something as there a lot at night in the room even though the doors and windows were shut all the time .,239873433
water pressure in the bathroom could also be improved .,239873433
other then that we had a good stay .,239873433
"we spent 3 days there , booked just 5 days before , 15 euro a night really nice pool and bar pool , quiet place , mixed people , nice indonesian food at the restaurant ! good breakfast ! Nice people easy to get Kuta center and the beach ! .",239453375
We booked in advance and requested single beds in a ground floor room ( 2 ladies travelling together ) .,238581625
We arrived to a double bed upstairs .,238581625
The pool was way too warm and not at all refreshing after a hot day out .,238581625
Then on day 3 of our stay the pool turned turned green .,238581625
Nobody could tell us when it would be fixed and didn ' t seem at all concerned They didn ' t stop people swimming even though it was highly likely you could get amoebic meningitis if the water went up your nose .,238581625
We departed after three days of no swimming .,238581625
Not happy .,238581625
Also they forgot to give us towels every single day .,238581625
"How hard is it ? On a positive note , the breakfast was simple but good .",238581625
I definitely wouldn ' t recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a guaranteed fun hotel .,238581625
I know it was cheap but you still .,238581625
"The hotel is a typical older style Bali hotel ; the rooms are large with reasonable furnishings , comfortable without extravagance .",237035056
"The breakfast was at best ordinary , but for the cost adequate .",237035056
"if you required better you would pay more , or use the local Warungs .",237035056
"Restaurants and shopping are within reasonable walking distance , but for the bulk of entertainment venues , take a taxi , Bluebird preferable as meter "" dos not gallop "" a charming local term .",237035056
The beach is a short stroll down the lane ; a walkway that takes you all the way to Kuta with access to most shopping venues is a pleasant place for walk or just to watch the beautiful Bali sunsets .,237035056
We found the hotel gardens and pool area a very pleasant area to relax in and like most holidays it is what you make it .,237035056
We have visited .,237035056
"There are some really good pros with the property - price - location - staff - pool area - breakfast included However the negatives outweigh them and while this place would be perfect for a boys weekend or the budget conscience , I would look elsewhere for a more intimate environment .",235337008
"The cons - dirty bathroom - rusty pipes - bad water smell - breakfast quality and variety I was unsure if to go 2 or 3 stars , on the last morning they forgot my omelette and then they changed the ( please make my room ) to do not disturb .",235337008
The staff are lovely and at the price you can launch yourself into Kuta .,235337008
"Pool area is brilliant and bintang was 25 , 000 for small and 35 , 000 for large so vary well priced ! .",235337008
Money well spent ! The rooms are cleaned every day to some point .,230512202
"We would go out and come back to a made bed and new towels , plus they give waterbottles for free everyday .",230512202
Wifi is ok but a bit slow sometimes .,230512202
The pool area is great but i noticed my hair gets dirty after being in the pool so its probably not very clean .,230512202
The bed wasn ' t very soft and comfy .,230512202
But Over all we had a great stay and definetly got more than we expected for the money .,230512202
I stayed at the hotel by myself and enjoyed the hotel .,230495019
"The hotel had excellent staff , great location with a short work to the beach and main tourist centre .",230495019
Its close to the airport with a short taxi ride .,230495019
I walked everywhere and felt safe all the time .,230495019
I will be retuning to Bali next year and will be staying at the same place .,230495019
"I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean , quite and friendly hotel to stay at .",230495019
"it does not have the big gardens like the main ausi hotels , but the friendly staff and cheap price make up for this .",230495019
Highly reccommend this hotel .,230495019
"I stayed here with my partner for the first half of my first ever trip to Bali ! This hotel is simple , super affordable and a great "" base "" if you ' re looking to see the sights , get out and about and shop and go out for dinners , and surf , like we did .",229131301
"The breakfast was very basic , just a pancake or a piece of toast , with juice or coffee ( although we stayed a few years ago and this might have changed ) but it was plenty for us before we headed out for the day .",229131301
"Such great helpful and friendly staff , clean tidy small rooms ( very ' old ' Bali style ) but enough if you ' re just looking for an aircon room , pool to jump in and a place to sleep in between exploring ! .",229131301
We only stayed for one night after a late arrival .,228548847
We had two triple rooms for my husband and I with our 4 children .,228548847
"Great value , close to beach and shopping .",228548847
"Nice pool area , although not many loungers .",228548847
"Room was ok , although not enough space for a longer stay .",228548847
We were on the third floor which was a bit of a hassle with trolley cases .,228548847
We couldn ' t contact the hotel to confirm our reservation and no - one answered the phone when we arrived at the airport as we had asked for a transfer .,228548847
"So we ended up getting two airport taxis which charged 70 , 000Rp each ! We booked through Agoda .",228548847
"We spent our last night in Bali at Bakungs Beach Hotel , and unfortunately it was a bad experience .",200182150
"While the rooms were clean and had AC , we felt very poorly treated by the entire staff .",200182150
"They all acted like we were not guests but rather pesks , and didn ' t respond to our "" pleases "" and "" thank yous "" ( we ' re a pretty low maintenance group ) .",200182150
"Additionally , we were asked to pay 50 , 000 Rph for the buffet breakfast ( included with some rooms ) , but the offerings were so meager I didn ' t want to pay any money for them at all .",200182150
"Additionally , the pool was under construction and there were no safes in the rooms as advertised .",200182150
"While the hotel is on an alleyway , it runs along a strip mall filled road that ' s pretty frustrating to walk along .",200182150
Even just as a stayover prior to a flight out of the .,200182150
I stayed in this hotel only for 2 nights with my friend .,196928042
We looked into the Booking review and it was not too bad .,196928042
"But when we arrived at our room it was terrible , we asked a room for non smokers and guess what cigarettes butts in the bathroom .",196928042
The sink was clogged and there was no curtains for the shower .,196928042
"We asked for another room , but they said that there was no room available .",196928042
So they promissed to do the maintenance and a proper cleaning in the room .,196928042
"If you are only worried about the location this is an average hotel , but for everything else I would not recommend this hotel .",196928042
stayed here for 2 nights in a standard room .,191697636
we choose a budget hotel as we were going to be out for most o the days and only needed a place to rest .,191697636
"In saying that the hotel is old style with nice manicured gardens , staff are friendly .",191697636
the standard rooms are just that .,191697636
there were no toiletries provided only 2 bars of soap .,191697636
the breakfast was shocking and had stomach aches after eating .,191697636
A new mall is located next door with a hypermarket there with everything you will need .,191697636
Although the hotel is not central you can walk or take a short taxi ride in .,191697636
the street has a few massage places and shops selling knick knacks .,191697636
Overalll I would spend a few extra dollars and stay somewhere a bit more upmarket .,191697636
We stayed for 4 nights here .,190934414
Our room was fine but it lacked natural light as it was in a position that literally avoided all sunlight ! The staff were friendly and welcoming and would always say hello .,190934414
"Our room looked little like the management pictures that it displays , with those 1960s itchy orange / brown blankets on the bed .",190934414
The blanket also had hair stuck to it which was not mine or my boyfriend ' s and this made me feel quite uncomfortable ! The rest of the room was okay though and had a very large bathroom but it was tile from top to bottom and was also a bit dated like the blankets .,190934414
There was a nice terrace outside our room with chairs and a table and also a drying rack .,190934414
The pool was refreshing but it really does need refurbishment as lots of the tiles are loose and .,190934414
"Upon arriving at the hotel around midnight I was greeted by friendly staff , although poor English ( doesnt bother me though ) , the lobby area gave a great first impression - clean and well presented .",180038621
"The hotel exterior , although dated and a little run down , had a traditional Balinese feel about it , and the gardens looked maintained enough .",180038621
The pool was clean and I did see a few small groups hanging around who seemed to be enjoying themselves .,180038621
"The standard room I was allocated on the other hand , was far from pleasing .",180038621
The towels in the bathroom were badly worn with threads hanging off everywhere and covered in stains .,180038621
The sheets had a few small tears and stains as well .,180038621
"Although , when the room was serviced the following day , I was provided with much cleaner and fresher linen .",180038621
No .,180038621
Stayed for 2 nights before going to Lombok .,176442126
Rooms basic but clean .,176442126
Linens and fridge clean .,176442126
Staff friendly and helpful .,176442126
"Continental breakfast adequate - Breads , fruit and juice and 2 hot dishes - the Bali coffee was the best we had in our 3 week trip ! In easy walking distance to lots of restaurants and very close the beach .",176442126
The new Tuban Hypermarket is only a 2 minute walk .,176442126
Only drawback to this hotel was the broken pool tiles in the large pool .,176442126
This put me off swimming as I did not want to risk a cut at the start of our holiday .,176442126
I stayed here for the second time in June .,164990291
I was really happy to see they are renovating the hotel and things have changed a little .,164990291
I love this little hotel value for money do cheap and the service is gret and always with a bit of cheekiness and a smile love the ladies gorgeous people and agung who is so cheeky but entertaining I will be staying here again and again ! ! ! ! ! .,164990291
Bakung has always been our Bali hotel .,149541511
"We had a break from Bali for 15 years but when we went back last June , it was as though we had only been away for a year .",149541511
True the hotel needs an upgrade but like all things in Bali changes are always on the move .,149541511
"The staff , including the kitchen staff , will make your stay memorable .",149541511
"Stay at Bakung , enjoy the shopping , the location , & book in for next time .",149541511
Andy & Elaine .,149541511
Look this hotel was cheap but we didn ' t spend much time in the room .,138376431
Our phone didn ' t work and the shower was awful .,138376431
But we did the holiday cheap .,138376431
So as the saying goes you get what you pay for .,138376431
Pool was a nice area gardens were pretty beds comfortable room nice bathroom needs work not the cleanest .,138376431
If you want to do it on a budget it ' s live able staff are friendly .,138376431
The dark alley out the front at night was my only concern walking back alone was a little daunting .,138376431
I ' ve stayed at Bakungs on a short visit which thankgod was only a one night stay .,129278205
This hotel is old and dirty .,129278205
On a second visit i stayed here but only for a few hours as i had a long wait before my flight and for $ 40 i didnt mind so much as i only wanted to use the shower and have some where cool to relax for a few hours .,129278205
This is probably the only time i would reccomend for anyone to try out Bakungs .,129278205
A few hours tops ! Any longer go some where else you will find better .,129278205
We stayed 3 nights here from 1st of April and I think we made a mistake .,127394269
"The room was very old , the bathroom looked much older than the room and the wall next to the building was falling apart .",127394269
If you where staying on the porch you had nothing to see nice .,127394269
The price was non - negotiable and in my opinion was high for what they offer .,127394269
The location is not good but it ' s quiet .,127394269
The pool was old but the water was very good for swimming .,127394269
The breakfast it ' s ok .,127394269
I think we are not coming back at this hotel being the worst we ever stayed in Bali and in the same time one of the most expensive one .,127394269
Towels and sheets grey if your lucky they are clean ! No room account and rooms airconditioner leaked consistently definitely not where I will go again .,117058975
