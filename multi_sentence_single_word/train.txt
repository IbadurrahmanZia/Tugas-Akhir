My mom and I stayed at a room with a balcony . The room is really bigger than most hotels . The staff are friendly and accommodating , but not really that happy with the buffet breakfast .

modern , value for money , but seems nothing to offer other than the room . well , it ' s spacious . but their service is somehow just so so . like it ' s just there , like it or not . recommended for honeymooners with budget consideration . don ' t bring child , they ' ll get bored . oh the pool is tidy .#### #### ####[([14], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [2], 'POS'), ([65], [67], 'NEG'), ([14], [21], 'POS')]

A small hotel with a decent bed and adequate facilities . Breakfast was mediocre and the menu was the same everyday . Some changes in variety would be an improvement . Staff was friendly .

This place is super cheap and for someone on a small budget . You can not really complain considering the price however the rooms do smell and are old and gross .

Palm Beach Hotel has a convenient location at about 2 kilometers from Bali International airport and a walking distance from Kuta beaches and busy life and activities . The hotel has a nice swimming pool and you can take a simple buffet breakfast there for around US $ 5 . The weak point is the wifi that seems quite chaotic .

Hotel is normal . The price is cheap . The location acceptable . It is around 4 blocks from the beach and 20 minutes walking to Kuta . Receptionist can be more friendly .

Rude stuff and inhumanity . Also seen a surfer got sick from the waves could hardly even walk , asked for help and they sent him away . Didnt let him even use the bathroom .

This is a nice budget friendly hotel in a good location in Kuta , however if you like to laze by the pool for long period ( in the sun ) then you may want to think twice about this hotel .

We paid $ 40 for the deluxe room . There wasn ' t anything wrong with the room really but the photos the website shows were probably taken 15 years ago . The room is old and so is the bathroom .

Cheap hotel , good location , by the beach . But the room is not clean enough when we check in , the toilet is not working well , and they have dirty linen .

Hi Guys , I have been in Kuta in Oct ' 19 1st week for honeymoon , Allotted room were stinky , classic swan towel decoration were not present . Rooms were not too clean .

A lovely hotel where the staff could not do enough for you . The food was good . The hotel room was compact but spotless , it was cleaned twice a day . I would definitely return .

We booked the Family Villa and the upstairs room was very spacious . Downstairs you had your own courtyard which included a fish pond .

Good hotel as in it will provide you with a clean place to stay near Kuta and Legian . Clean bed , bathroom and basic tv . Nice pool for a dip .

Our flight from the UK arrived late so we booked a night here before going on across Bali . No regrets about this , air con was good , beds incredibly comfy and extras such as water / soap / fridge included . Only cons : thin walls and the shower flooded out a bit .

The room is nice although there is a little spot on the bed when i checked in . . . Recommend to have a room on ground floor which have access to the pool . . .

Decent and isolated hotel with a goal course . Ideal for travelers seeking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Nusa Dua .

The biggest plus point is location . Just on the market and opposite beach . Bathroom needs renovation . . it is rusted . Small spider in my room after I checked in .

But mind the Chinese crowd there .#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([2], [0], 'POS'), ([7], [9], 'POS'), ([11], [13], 'POS'), ([46], [49], 'POS'), ([31], [30], 'NEG')]
Great location in Legian close to many restaurants and shops . Very cheerful staff . Breakfast was bleak but Coffee Corner was nearby and was my daily go to . Cleaning was a bit hit and miss and the bathroom could have done with a deep clean . Acceptable at the price and if visiting Bali again , I would consider it .#### #### ####[([7], [4], 'POS'), ([9], [4], 'POS'), ([13], [12], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'NEG'), ([30], [36], 'NEG'), ([51], [48], 'NEU')]
For the price this hotel excellent . Rooms are large and comfortable . Pool area was a bit rundown but functional . Location suited me but a lot of building work going on in streets nearby .

Pool area is very small and one day it was so dirty that it was not possible to swim . Hotel is clean but need little reform .

Old style building with a central courtyard and pool area . Unfortunately the pool doesn ' t get a lot of sun and is chilly . Room was clean and functional .

Nice pool area with views to the busy airport . Wifi is good , breakfast is not bad and I like the style of the hotel . However , the restaurant food is a bit boring .

Stayed here for a few days in October , and the hotel is in a lovely location with very large rooms . The restaurant / breakfast were very good value and the service was faultless .

So . . . you are in transit waiting for your next flight and have been kicked out of your hotel at mid - day . This is the answer . 10 minutes by their free shuttle to the airport . Clean , nice pool , good food ( tho of course unexciting ) and helpful staff . A lot better than hanging around for 9 hours at the airport in Denpasar .#### #### ####[([44], [41], 'POS'), ([44], [43], 'POS'), ([47], [46], 'POS'), ([56], [55], 'POS')]

Great value . Great location . Modern decor . Major let down is no pool to swim in . Well the tiny pool is next to the restaurant and not inviting for swimmers or sunbathers .

Affordable , really friendly staff , nice rooms .

The Amaris Hotel Legian was our first stop in Indonesia . Its just about 15 minutes drive ( take a blue bird taxi ! ! ) from the airport .

Nice homestay with a pool , but the room had a very weird smell . Also there was a light shining through our window all night long so it was bit difficult to sleep .

Everyone on the staff was so nice . The level of service was the definition of hospitality . The room was very large . My wife loved the spa ! ! And the prices were so reasonable that we didn ' t expect the high quality we received . The restaurant ( Pistachio ) was excellent . This is definitely the place to stay in Ubud .#### #### ####[([3], [6], 'POS'), ([19], [22], 'POS'), ([28], [26], 'POS'), ([33], [36], 'NEU'), ([45], [44], 'POS'), ([50], [55], 'POS')]

Stayed here to be close to the airport on the last leg of our trip . The hotel is so so . In terms of cleanliness it would be 2 stars . Location would be 3 stars . Customer service 4 stars .

well my stay there was ok but not excellent the room was kept clean and was well insulated enough so i could sleep without the aircon on . had some trouble getting the reception staff to understand requests and they couldn ' t answer most of my queries . the biggest problem though was being woken up before dawn each day by the barracks across the road .#### #### ####[([10], [13], 'POS')]

Before continuing my travel on my arrival from Europe I stayed at this hotel near the airport to handle a jet leg and to relax .

Perhaps the Flores coffee is a little better but all over Indonesia good Arab / Turkish style coffee is to be found .#### #### ####[([26], [25], 'NEU'), ([41], [40], 'NEG'), ([20], [19], 'POS'), ([17], [16], 'POS'), ([9], [7], 'POS')]

Our room was damp and smelt absolutely vile , the bed sheets were filthy ; stained with blood and grime . The food was awful , microwaved and over priced .

Don ' t get a room with pool access . It ' s appealing but the noise won ' t stop until 11pm even though according to their rules it ' s 10pm .

Small , plain and efficient ( somewhat devoid of character ) . A typical business hotel . We think our room was swiped with salt water as the floor was sticky .

The hotel is reasonably clean but very crowded . It is near some beaches and some culinary places . The breakfast varies every morning .

We were paying about £17 a night which in my opinion was far too much . The wifi was appalling , the pool area was completely inadequate , without any loungers or even any space for lounging for that matter .

Excellant service from all staff - nothing too much trouble - my room was cleaned when I wanted it to be daily with no fuss from staff close to beach - cooked breakfast super cool swimming pool , near to all the shops you could ever need .

This hotel whilst not rated 5 star give you most of the conveniences afforded to a 5 star hotel a a fraction of the cost . This hotel is one of the older ones but the service is equally as good .

The biggest downside is the area , I didnt really like it and getting transportation around here is quite difficult .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([5], [4], 'POS'), ([12], [15], 'POS'), ([12], [17], 'POS'), ([12], [36], 'POS')]

We had the all inclusive package which is a good deal considering the food and drink prices are expensive .

We love this hotel but we ' re so surprised how much it has deteriorated since 2012 . However in 2012 it cost three times more to stay . Great staff . Wonderful complimentary breakfast . Internet good . Corner rooms abysmal . They moved us the second day but this was very inconvenient .

If you are looking for a budget hotel with no frills then Grandmas is a good option close to Seminiyak beach . Its walking distance .

For the price , and if you are willing to fight the traffic , it ' s a reasonable choice for the budget conscious traveler .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([7], [6], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS')]
The facilities are bit old . Value for money . nice area . good breakfast , nice pool , good for families with kids . Use Grab app for traveling short distances . If using for airport drivers will cheat by producing a fake parking for 50000 rp .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG'), ([11], [10], 'POS'), ([14], [13], 'POS'), ([17], [16], 'POS')]
We used the Harris as a base for a visit around East Java . The hotel was very covenient . The location , very close to the airport , is very good , On our return from East Java we returned to the Harris for a stopover for six hours before catching our international flight on to Sydney .#### #### ####[([15], [18], 'POS'), ([21], [24], 'POS'), ([21], [31], 'POS')]
Hotel is extremely beautiful with almost all the amenities you may want from a resort . Very well maintained with staff who are always more then happy to help you out . Huge property with beach area completely useless at the time of my visit .#### #### ####[([0], [3], 'POS'), ([14], [8], 'POS')]

A basic hotel in a small village . Cheap but fine to visit local sites . The rooms are a bit old & worn out but fine to sleep . Our balcony door didn ' t lock ( it was broken ) but the staff assured us it was safe ! And it was . I wouldn ' t stay here long - a night or two is plenty to see the area .#### #### ####[([31], [49], 'POS'), ([28], [26], 'POS'), ([17], [21], 'NEG'), ([12], [10], 'POS'), ([12], [8], 'NEG'), ([2], [1], 'NEU')]
Everything was great except the wifi signal are really bad . The room is clean , tidy , spacious and very comfortable as well . The breakfast provided are not bad but kinda salty for my taste bud and there are less variety . The location are awesome . I can easily access to Kuta Beach and basically walk to the store and club . Night life in Kuta are really happening .#### #### ####[([12], [14], 'POS'), ([12], [16], 'POS'), ([12], [18], 'POS'), ([12], [21], 'POS'), ([45], [47], 'POS')]
Kevin who works in the gym and the Golf simulator was absolutely amazing . He made us feel very welcomed , comfortable and confident in playing golf and working out in the gym . We constantly booked Golf with Kevin as we had the most amazing time . He is a great and hard working man . Highly recommend .#### #### ####[([0], [12], 'POS'), ([5], [21], 'POS')]
Only stayed here for one night . Couldn ' t fault the room . Comfortable bed , large balcony , fridge , kettle etc . Could of done with more than 1 towel in the bathroom . Breakfast not the best , but I was happy with toast and cereal .#### #### ####[([15], [14], 'POS'), ([18], [17], 'POS')]
Terrible wifi , terrible service , horrendous breakfast . If you need anything you have to ring reception at least 3 times and probably still won ’ t be sorted . Far away from tourist locations and eateries , so very impractical . Broken ammenities in room . 0 / 5 stars if I could .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'NEG'), ([4], [3], 'NEG'), ([7], [6], 'NEG'), ([44], [43], 'NEG')]
Having stayed in other locations in Bali , Maharani Beach Hotel was in a good area for shopping . Staff were awesome , and our room was always perfectly clean . Only thing i have to complain about is average breakfast .#### #### ####[([19], [21], 'POS'), ([25], [29], 'POS'), ([39], [40], 'POS')]
It is a beautiful hotel . I personally loves the room interior . But couldn ' t enjoy it more when on the very first and last night there i spent my bedtime scratching . And it were not mosquitos . They were bed bugs ! ! Nasty !#### #### ####[([32], [33], 'NEG'), ([4], [3], 'POS')]
