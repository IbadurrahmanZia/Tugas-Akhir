The hotel was spacious , clean and had some great views from the hotel roof pool . However it definitely needed basic hotel amenities like a pool bar and a gym . The hotel is quite far away from bars and restaurants ( 20 min cab ) so do not stay here if you want to be able to walk anywhere . The staff were very friendly and helpful .#### #### ####[([63], [66], 'POS'), ([63], [68], 'POS'), ([10], [9], 'POS'), ([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [5], 'POS'), ([39], [36], 'NEG'), ([41], [36], 'NEG')]

There is nothing to do in Nuda Dua for a solo traveler . The hotel charges 300 % mark - up for everything including activities . The food sucks and it is definitely not a 5 star . It is an old hotel that needs a serious revamp . No usb port to charge your phone , old TVs . TINY room . I hated my stay here .#### #### ####[([27], [28], 'NEG'), ([58], [57], 'NEG'), ([61], [60], 'NEG')]
The reception was not friendly at all . It seemed a security man , untrained welcoming guests . The room was clean but the bathroom door was chipped . No toothbrush n the towels had stained all over n the color was not white anymore . A hotel with the price of 60USD n more should have been better in hospitality , including caring for the towels .

This place was terrible . . . What you see in the pictures online and what you get are worlds apart . . . I would advise anybody considering this hotel to book elsewhere . . .

The room is very large but furnishing a bit old . The kitchen is useless for me . The hotel is in a golf course , great for golfer . but do not have beach front although the swimming pool is nice . Service is very good . Also organised tours for you with hotel pickup .

A great resort only let down by staff shortages as a result of covid . One of the restaurants ( Japanese ) was closed during our stay . It opened the day we left !
