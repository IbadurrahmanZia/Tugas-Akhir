Booked a superior room on the 5th floor , stayed for 3 nights at the Aston Inn , and i liked the room i was booked in . Never had a chance to try the breakfast though .

This looks like an amazing hotel at first glance . A beautiful lobby and roof top pool with a bar .

We stayed here with friends as part of a wedding and were made to feel very welcome . The lovely staff and pool area is definitely a bonus .

A nice hotel to stay in , away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist strip . Was here for 8 days and was a pleasant stay . Really good pool .

Booked in for day use before late flight . Hotel is old and needs attention . Reception would not change a 50k note for transport .

I can say Lake View Hotel has the best view among any other hotel in Kintamani . The view of Batur Mountain and Batur Lake is truly beautiful . The service is good and friendly . The new Danu Spa also offers a good relaxing massage . But , I think the foods quality still need to be improved . Overall , I always enjoy my stay in this hotel .#### #### ####[([4], [8], 'POS'), ([18], [27], 'POS'), ([30], [32], 'POS'), ([30], [34], 'POS')]
If you are looking for a cheaper alternative for Bali and do not plan to do much in the hotel , this is for you . The bathrooms were fair size but the room itself was pretty small . Overall it is an average hotel in Bali .

Plus : Hotel staff are very nice , professional and very helpful . Minus : The hotel does not fulfill 5 star requirements . Quite expensive but poor maintenance of hotel amenities and facility . The hotel including breakfasts is opted for Chinese tour bus groups . Hope for the best , prepare for the worst .

Everything there looks brand new , rooms , swimming pool , restaurant , etc , the location it is a little bit crazy , it is on the main road , if you need to cross the road . oooooo forget it , gonna take hours to do it safety , but they have daily free shuttle bus to KUTA center , easy to do shopping .#### #### ####[([65], [62], 'POS')]

This hotel is good value for money considering the clean and comfortable room , the big swimming pool and breakfast was included . The location is good too .

I think this is even worse than a Budget Hotel qualifications . . I got a room on 3rd floor and surprised there was no Lift / Elevator , the shower only small drops of water and hot water not working . Breakfast also very poor only 2 - 3 choices . . so I considered this is a Motel .#### #### ####[([42], [45], 'NEG')]
had to buy my own air freshener . Foul smell coming from the toilet . Furnitures all seem worn out . No lifts . Needs major facelift seriously . My bad for trying this place . Located deep within dark corridor street .#### #### ####[([22], [21], 'NEG'), ([36], [37], 'NEG')]
Excellent service all around and very convenient to the airport . Shuttle leaves hourly at 15 - 20 past the hour . They organised a driver for me to visit Bali Bird Park at a reasonable rate .

restu is in the hub of legian and very close to all the shops and main hustle and bustle if kuta but it is a quiet lush oasis and you would never know you were in the busiest part .

The hotel is located a walk away from Legian street ( notice that walk is not the most pleasent one because there is no decent sidewalk ) . We had a family room with three single beds .

A very nice hotel in Kuta , about 200m to Kuta beach . But most of the time , the taxis doesnt know where this hotel is . It is beside Oasis hotel , which is quite well - known . Near to Legian , and Poppies lane 1 . Basically , in the middle of a tourist place .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'POS')]

AC is not working , when we informed the housekeeping , a staff came to clean the filter and that ' s all . . . no cool air at all for three nights , the floor is sticky , shower soap was smelly and no refill of coffee on the last night stay , when we called housekeeping , no answer .#### #### ####[([36], [38], 'POS')]

I am not a type of person loving to stay in a " crowded " place like Kuta . But , just recently stayed in this hotel for a short transit . Nice live music by the entrance .

Price is cheap ! Location is okay , though it took me an hour to walk from here to the crowded area near seminyak square . Our room was small , however it was more than enough for two people .

I have been 2 times staying in this hotel . last time was on 22 Oct 2012 but only for 1 night . In general the hotel is nice , seems still new and located quite close to the airport .
